"], ["Samiran Dam", "Mixed Feelings - Good display, Not so good Camera, Suitable for Multitasking ", "\n I bought Lenovo K3 Note in the second flash sale and got it in my hand after SIX days!!! So, I would like to thank Flipkart not for the delayed delivery, but for the quick response to the reported malfunctioning of the new device and fast delivery of its replacement.    \nSo, here it is what happened - on the third day of receiving the new Lenovo K3, I woke up in the morning to discover that the phone's display was messed-up. White and black flickering lines were appearing on the screen. I tried to factory reset and running the app - &quot;Dead Pixel - Detect &amp; Fix&quot;. Nothing seemed to be curing the problem. However, the Flipkart Customer Support, I would say, was excellent in responding to this particular issue and after trying different troubleshooting steps, they approved the return request. And I received the replacement within three days :). This is why I just love shopping through Flipkart. They are really professional.   \nNow coming to the review of the Lenovo K3 Note, the device is more than excellent in this price range. I am really loving it.    \nHowever, I have observed occasional heating-up issue although I have not figured out what may be the probable cause, because, sometimes given the same conditions, the phone heats-up and at the other times it does.    \nWhile playing Ashphalt Airborne 8 car racing game, sometimes the visual got stuck - it happened 2-3 times in, say, 20 minutes of continuous action.    \nThe camera quality is good but not worthy of a 13 MP camera. Having done photography for long time and handling different types of camera, I can say it is probably because of the sensor. So, 13 MP may help in printing large photos, but the poor sensor yields noisy images even in low ISOs (e.g. ISO 200). The selfie camera's quality is even poorer with no flash option. So, those who want a good camera in their phones, specially a good selfie camera, my strong suggestion is that don't go for this device.    \nThe display of the phone is excellent. Watching a 1080p movie in this device is a pure bliss.   \nThe other features are very good and as of now I do not have any complaints.

It was surely a mouth watering offering looking at specifications of phone on plane paper but all excitement ends when I actually started to use the phone!  \nI will start with pros first since they are not many: \n1. Budget phone - decent price tag  \n2. Full HD screen \n3. Light weight  \nBut like I said there is a big list of cons that really will kill all your expectations that a mediocre to heavy user might be having from this phone (please note that casual phone user might not find these as a big con since they wont use the phone to full potential)  \n1. Battery is a big letdown - Initially flipkart advertised the battery to be of 300mAh which actually was a false promotion!! The battery capacity is actually 2900mAh. Under normal circumstances even 2900mAh battery should be able to hold up for 1 day but in this phone this is not the case,... if you are using your phone for making few phone calls, use GPS for about 30-45 minutes, play few games for about 10-15 minutes and voila - you will see battery about to get drained off!!!! For me I always found battery not lasting for more than 9 hours (best case) with usage mentioned above.  \n2. Software - Lenovo has provided a software that might appeal to many to start with but there seems to be some major issues - after continuous usage and doing some multitasking phone will not respond smoothly - you need to clear RAM or need to reboot to make it work normally again!  \nAbove 2 are basics of any mobile, which, if are wrong, then phone will fail to deliver for sure! \nApart from above 2 major cons, there are other cons as well to add to the list: \n1. High SAR \n2. Very low quality back cover \n3. Battery not easily removable once fit in. \n4. No scratch resistant screen! \n5. Very bad audio quality from speakers - Dolby Atmos is just a false marketing gimmick! Don't fall for it. \n6. Bluetooth connectivity - phone speaker will turn on for a fraction of second when you receive a call using bluetooth headset - at times when we dial a call using phone connected to bluetooth headset then call doesn't gets transferred to bluetooth device automatically! Unreliable!  \n7. Bad rear camera - failed to live up to expectations - extremely slow to focus and pictures are too grainy. \nIn all, Lenovo did a very good job in creating a hype of this phone but in reality this is a phone that will kill your expectations! Definitely a Killer Note!! "]], "title": "Lenovo K3 Note"}

It seems that companies like Mi and Asus launch the phone and then based on customer feedback keep on updating their software. Rather they should be fully satisfied themselves with the quality check before launching a new phone. I have already had 3 updates done so far. Few more are in pipeline. If one issue is sorted out by one update, then a new one arises.   \nOverall it is like any other 8k-10k bracket phone. Call quality is ok, camera is also decent, though not as great as advertised by Asus. Battery is a let down. No matter how many steps you take to reduce the drain, by evening you will have to charge it. I am a moderate user mainly for calls, still by 6-7pm battery crashes to 25-30%. Size is a bit bulky which leads to increase in weight. Touch is responsive and works well.   \nIts an average phone, nothing great about it.

Sim2 was not working. So I went to service center and the customer representative confirmed that yes there is an issue with that lot. She gave one letter(confirming bug) and told me to ask for replacement from flipkart. Flipkart executive initiated my replacement easily as I told him about my visit to the service center.   \nThe replaced phone I received was really good. Below is my review about it. Please note I use my phone for : \nweb Surfing: 2G/3G \nListneing music: 4hrs \nGame: 1hr \nVideo: 1/2 hr   \nUsing only single sim.   \nPros: \n========= \n1. Super build quality. Phone looks awsome and sturdy. \n2. Display is really nice. Color reproduction is good. It has gorilla glass. \n3. Camera quality very good in Day time and avg in night. Camera got better after new updates. So please update before using. Best thing is &quot;manual option&quot; provided for people who want to take photograph according their own setting. I didnt see this option in many other phones. Easy to take selfie as volume rocker acts as click. \n4. Frequent security and bug update from Asus made this phone really stand out as compared to other indian(Micromax) and chinese phones. \n5. Inbuilt apps are really useful for eg: Ram booster, Live Asus support Chat, \n6. Sound is good. Would suggest to buy JBL headphones   \nCons: \n======= \n!. Battery is not that good. It runs for 1 day if full charged and average use in 2g. In 3G it runs for ~15hrs. If you play more games, pls dont buy this. New updates improved battery backup but not that much. If you use dual sim, battery will drain more. \n2. Mobile do gets heated if using 3G internet or playing game. But not that much. \n3. Flash light sometimes add yellow light or color in images \n4. Android 5. It has lots of bugs. Asus is planing to release 5.1 but dont know. \n5. I have 2GB Ram.System takes around 1.2 GB of that. Its because of Android 5 may be. \n6. No headphone provided \n7.2nd sim can only be used for 2G calling and not for 3G/4G and internet.

My view about this phone is overwhelming. It is the best for all-rounder use I think under 20k in India considering the price factor, availability of service center, value for money, looks etc that concern Indian ethics when it comes to buying electronics gadgets.   \nHere are the certain points that I want to mention.   \n1. The display is IPS grade screen with the best resolution colour reproduction that I have seen in any set under 20000. One may even like to compare it with IPhone's Retina display standard. \n2. The basic function is calling, so here also it scores pretty good. I mean voice clarity is good ( may not be the best atleast, I have tested on Reliance GSM).  \n3. High Speed internet experience is very good. Really enjoyed the experience. \n4. Regarding display here is also another point to mention in all other smartphones in the 5&quot; IPS display category most of the manufacturers have put digital touch buttons on the screen as such although having 5&quot; screen the user gets only around 4.5&quot; - 4.7&quot; not the full 5&quot;. \n6. There is radio. But the radio quality is around average. \n7. The music player is there with several customizations. To have the best sound experience I would recommend either download a better player, or customize the sound equalizer. I have customized the sound equalizer and getting sound with quality and clarity of that of the Sony walkman series. I love the music.To the complement the sound jacks provided (please readjust the earbuds provided to have the best fit in the ears) are really good. \n8. The camera primary as well as secondary are super. Amazingly it can click MACRO quality images (with apparture 2.0 to 2.8, by default its 2.8). Normal photography may be compared to any 13mp sensor. Its very good. There are other modes too. Please check these modes over youtube. You can find easily. \nInfact the camera sensor is that of sony. \nThere is an Image stabilization for photos as well as videos. The phone can easily record video at 1920x1080 at 30 fps. \n9. The game quality is very good. Yesterday I have checked it with Modern combat 5 as well as asphalt 8. Both ran smoothly. Infact to test its RAM management I kept both games running and jumped between the 2 using the multitasking button around 3 times. No lag was there. Infact the colour reproduction for each frames was super with the full 5&quot; display support. \n10. Regarding multi-tasking tested with 20 opened apps (Non- gaming general apps) no lag was there. It is a fine experience. \n11. For all those who are complaining about the battery please see the settings. Actually when the phone is stated all the power consuming services are on. Please adjust the app configurations. I mean when you are not using data connections stop the auto sync etc. Infact asus has provide in the phone the power saving mode use this mode. Infact I have configured this and getting a backup comparable to that of MOTO G. \n12. I have tested the phone in Atuntu banchmark today.

Rather they should be fully satisfied themselves with the quality check before launching a new phone. I have already had 3 updates done so far. Few more are in pipeline. If one issue is sorted out by one update, then a new one arises.   \nOverall it is like any other 8k-10k bracket phone. Call quality is ok, camera is also decent, though not as great as advertised by Asus. Battery is a let down. No matter how many steps you take to reduce the drain, by evening you will have to charge it. I am a moderate user mainly for calls, still by 6-7pm battery crashes to 25-30%. Size is a bit bulky which leads to increase in weight. Touch is responsive and works well.   \nIts an average phone, nothing great about it.

Phone looks awsome and sturdy. \n2. Display is really nice. Color reproduction is good. It has gorilla glass. \n3. Camera quality very good in Day time and avg in night. Camera got better after new updates. So please update before using. Best thing is &quot;manual option&quot; provided for people who want to take photograph according their own setting. I didnt see this option in many other phones. Easy to take selfie as volume rocker acts as click. \n4. Frequent security and bug update from Asus made this phone really stand out as compared to other indian(Micromax) and chinese phones. \n5. Inbuilt apps are really useful for eg: Ram booster, Live Asus support Chat, \n6. Sound is good. Would suggest to buy JBL headphones   \nCons: \n======= \n!. Battery is not that good. It runs for 1 day if full charged and average use in 2g. In 3G it runs for ~15hrs. If you play more games, pls dont buy this. New updates improved battery backup but not that much. If you use dual sim, battery will drain more. \n2. Mobile do gets heated if using 3G internet or playing game. But not that much. \n3. Flash light sometimes add yellow light or color in images \n4. Android 5. It has lots of bugs. Asus is planing to release 5.1 but dont know. \n5. I have 2GB Ram.System takes around 1.2 GB of that. Its because of Android 5 may be. \n6. No headphone provided \n7.2nd sim can only be used for 2G calling and not for 3G/4G and internet.

But all my phones had pitiable RAM and ROM that I could not just install all the apps I wanted to. To own an Android phone with huge internal memory was always my dream, that too within a budget. I've bought Micromax Android One as soon as it was launched, and was happy for a while. But it too had lot of issues with low quality hardware etc. When I saw the specifications of ASUS Zenfone 2 on flipkart, I know that this is what I always wanted and so I ordered immediately. I am now convinced that it was one of the good decisions I have made.   \nPros: 16 GB memory! You can install all the apps you wanted to and still have plenty of memory left. What more? You can also insert SD card to store music and video files, without eating up too much of your ROM. If you still want more, then go for ASUS 32 GB version. 2 GB RAM is just sufficient for my day to day use, but if you are gadget freak and use your mobile for playing games etc, go for 4 GB RAM version.   \nCons: Only thing that bothers me is removal of back panel to insert sim.

The product I will received will be new or not and what bout it's warranty terms &amp; conditions etc. \nSo solve a few of these issues I ordered this product under Cash on delivery mode. \nI was informed that the product will be delivered to my location in 20 days from the date of booking of the phone. Which initially got be a bit worried. But then my phone was delivered on the 6th day itself. The parcel was tamper proof and was intact. The phone I received was fresh &amp; genuine one as was confirmed in due course of registering the same on the Apple Site. The product is also duly covered under the apple's warranty scheme. So no loss there either! So well done Flipkart and the retailer WS Retail! I am an old online buyer from your site. With this you just enhanced my faith on your services. \nNow about the phone: \nThe phone and its interface is just awesome. Being a first time I Phone user I was blown away by what the interface itself has to offer. Even the smallest of things have been taken care of in the IOS. This phone makes other Smart Phone (used by me earlier) look like not so smart. The phone is working just fine. The camera of the phone is a class apart and is one of the main attractions of the same. The screen quality and the speed of the phone is also awesome. Browsing is just awesome. Last but not the least the SIRI is also there. So over all an extremely awesome and great value for money. Thanks Flipkart once again........will be back with the detailed performance review of the phone later!

The thing I disliked most is the length of charging cable which is way too short. The charging/usb port is on the bottom side of the phone and with that short charging cable it is almost impossible to use it while charging. The most disgusting thing is the touch scroll totally stops functioning when I tried to use it while charging. It occured every time. But when I used Micromax charger in it then the scrolling function worked properly. The battery life is moderate. The good things are surfing net and other things are really easy on it. Camera is very good...specially the selfie camera. Overall I think the software in this phone should have been more updated to clear out all such small but annoying issues with this phone.

This is a hands-on review after using it for couple of hours, so I don't know about any long term disadvantages.  \nFirst of all, it has got quite good looks for a phone this cheap. The black version, which I ordered, is gorgeous and in no way does it look like a cheap phone. You have my word on this. Also, The back cover is matte and scratch resistance. \nThe screen is not Gorilla Glass and is very highly reflective. So you always see reflection while using it, which is very annoying while gaming or watching videos. (I would suggest going for matte finish screen guard). Also the LCD is a little sunken from the main touch screen.The automatic brightness control is good but for such a reflective screen you have to use the manual controls to keep the brightness a little high. Overall the screen is one of the cons and the first thing that reminds you that this is a cheap phone. \nThe ZenUI is just amazing. Best UI i've seen after Sony. I have used Zenfone 4 and 5 and ZenUI is just as awesome as before. There are some changes like the Reading Mode (gives the screen a yellow-ish tint) is missing. \nThe camera is 5 MP on 4:3 ratio pictures. For those who click photos on 16:9 ratio (almost everyone), it is actually 4 MP. The outdoor picture quality is good and seeing the price, you could hardly get any better. The indoor quality varies according to the amount of lighting, flash on/off and night mode (overall it's grainy and very average). The front camera is disappointing and barely usable. \nThe sound quality is extraordinarily good. I mean it's excellent for this price bracket. I have used much more expensive phones than this, and most of them disappointed in all ways. It might not be able to go too loud, but while most phones have shrill trebles, this phone gives an amazing range of bass too. Overall, its crystal clear (no tearing) and gives the full range of trebles and bass. \nIt does have heating problem sometimes, and many people concern themselves with it, but it's really is not a problem until it becomes very extremely hot. This is one other con and the second thing that remind you this is a cheap phone. \nBattery is running okay and quite good for an android phone. Although the phone does take more time to charge than other phones.  \nAlthough it most certainly won't give you the feel of a high end phone, it remains very worthy of the price in most aspects. If it's good for you, that you have to decide.  \nNote: This is a hands-on review so I haven't written anything about connectivity problems, internet usage, benchmarks, or any problems that might manifest in the long run.

I fall in love at first sight. \n[my rating=10/10]   \nDisplay: 4.5inch big screen is good with 854 x 480 Pixels.

The value for money quotient is very high as you get much more of a device then we pay for.   \nCons   \n1. Tinny speakers with very low audio output. \n2. The camera could've been better.

I have been using this phone for the past 2 months. No major problems found.Battery backup depends on the phone( Internet) usage. "], ["Vivek buv", "Good and worthable for money ", "\n product is good  \nSpeed also good but camera in night is too bad its looks like shaded images  \nbut all other future are good "], ["Diptangshu Chaki", "In depth review of Asus ZenFone 2 ", "\n 1.DESIGN \nThe phone's design is definitely not something that would appwal you to buy. In terms of ergonomics, the phone is quite large to fit in your hands.The volume buttons are nicely placed on the back below the camera module. The power button is oddly placed on the top but is not that difficult to use (although you have the option to tap the screen to unlock). There are three capacitive buttons below the display which offers tactile feedback but are non-backlit. The Asus logo lies just below the earpiece. The earphone slot is at the top along with the noise cancellation mic and the power button. With 3.9mm thickness at the edges, it provides you a good grip.At the back lies the camera with a dual tone flash above it and also the loudspeaker at the bottom.   \n2. USER INTERFACE \nZenfone 2 comes with Zen UI. The interface looks beautiful and is customizable to a huge extent. But the UI is not stable as of yet, it has a quite a lot of bugs.The good thing is Asus is providing a lot of updates to make it bug free. Despite being heavily customized, the UI doesn't make the phone sluggish, thanks to its 4GB RAM. What I liked the most about the UI is that every single application ( like default camera,music player,dialer) can be updated from the playstore. With this the app doesn't only get better but also gets new features. If the update is not to to your liking, you can always uninstall the updates.   \n3. CAMERA \nThe ZenFone 2 uses a 13 megapixel Toshiba senor at the back.The same sensor is also used by many mid range Lumia models. It is just that the Asus didn't find the correct algorithm to get the best out of the camera module. The images are sometimes undersaturated under daylight and over exposed under artificial lighting conditions. The front camera takes decent selfies. A lot has improved after the two system updates. The camera quality is good now but is not at par with Mi4 and One plus one. The software enhancements provided by Asus with its pixelmaster camera are excellent. One can tweak with the many modes provided along with the manual mode to get the best shot. Lowlight mode does match up to its hype. It can click pictures in such darkness that it would put high end phones to shame. The output it delivers in low light mode doesn't have accurate colors and appears a bit grainy but it still shows up with an image where most other phones will fail too. The 'depth of field' mode focusses the subject and blurs the other objects. It works good to some extent but needs improvement. Hopefully Asus will provide further updates.   \n4. SOUND \nThe sound output is really low on loudspeaker. Although the speaker grills are relatively large on the back, the output is not at all loud. The sound doesn't get muffled, thanks to its curvy back. While on earphones the experience is entirely different. The output is loud and delivers a good quality even at high volumes. The surround sound effect is excellent and the bass levels are good.   \n5. DISPLAY \nZenFone 2 comprises of a full HD IPS panel. The colors are good but not as good as any AMOLED displays. The display is not very bright and is slightly on the dull side. The viewing angles are good. There are various modes to choose from and you can even set your own saturation levels. The display performa best under the vivid mode and legibility under sunlight is good.   \n6.BATTERY \nDespite packing a powerful 3000mAh battery, it fails to last a day. With moderate usage, it lasts around 12 hours. As the phone comes with Lollipop 5.0, battery issues are bound to happen. Hope the battery issue gets fixed with the next upgrade.   \n7.PERFORMANCE \nIn terms of performance, this phone is a beast. It can handle anything you throw at it. With 4GB of RAM, you can run twenty odd applications simultaneously with ease. I didn't notice any lag till now in my usage.   \n8. OTHERS \nCall reception quality is good.App gets crashed at times since the UI is not stable as I mentioned earlier.   \nOverall a good buy at this price but definitely not comparable to any of the flagship models.

What not the phone offers  \n4GB RAM \n2.3 GHz processor is really awesome. Graphics are awesome. Played Asphalt 8 without any glitch. \nAsus in built One Touch RAM Booster (as in other ASUS phones) in the notification bar menu. \nStart up Manager (Where you can select which apps to auto start when phone reboots thus saving memory). \n4G support. \nHigh speed Wifi and USB transfer. \nIt also has cover feature where once you attach the special cover of ASUS, it helps in answering calls without even opening the flip cover. \nThe volume button at the back is well placed. \nYou can double tap on the screen to lock or unlock the screen via activating the Touch Feature in the menu (no need to go for the on/off button on top). \nDownloadable Themes and it's in built apps are really helpful (like the ASUS keyboard where the numbers come with the alphabets as a separate line and not merged with the qwerty line or a separate button). \nMoreover there is an app ASUS support where regular notifications come from ASUS on the new developments and helpful features for the phone. So if you have some doubt that's the best place to visit. \n3000 mah Battery easily goes for a day and when not used much can go for 2 days. \nThe best feature is the super fast charging. The ASUS charger charges the phone from 0 to 100 in under 1 hour.   \nSome things to look for : \nSpeaker sound is normal and not too loud. I feel that is fine if you are going for a 20k phone and not a 3000 chinese loudspeaker phone \n3G/4G is only available on SIM 1 slot. \nBattery is non detachable but back cover can be removed for sim card and memory card. \nEarlier there were heating and camera issues but regular updates have fixed that. \nNo Headphones with the phone.

", "\n Using this phone for the last 5 days...Its sleek edge design is good ,weight is evenly distributed, looks good in hand. when comings to processing power, its a beast comparing to other top end smartphones with a considerable price. The 4gb ram does wonders with the new Android Lolly pop on a Zen UI (the UI still needs lots of work, getting updates continuously). It can multitask efficiently, u don't even want to close apps and boost your phone unnecessarily, so far it doesn't lagged even while playing HD games with all applications opened. The 13mp camera with dual flash is pretty good...could be better in low lights, i don't expect it to be in DSLR quality (Regularly getting updates for camera improvement too from Asus). The front camera is good for selfies in bright light, don't expect more. Abiding by other reviewers it has its drawback, U can live with it, no serious ones in the below list, \n1, The phone heats up while in charging (because of the fast charging technology, don't try to attend longer calls in charging , it heats up your ear, the processor is near to the listening speaker ),  \n2, Sound quality is good and neat, fine for voice calls, cant play loud music. \n3, The battery discharge is like 8.5% to 9% per hour in idle mode with WiFi or mobile data on, and 12 to 15 % per hour in continuous all around daily usage for me. The total discharge time from 100 to 0 is 7-9 hours approx.....(it has various power saving modes to adjust battery discharge). \n4, The volume rocker in the back is good and power button in the top doesn't annoyed me much, thanks to double tapping screen wake up. \n5, it has all needed sensors, touch sensitivity on gorilla glass is good, and don't expect super Almoled HD display quality from its IPS screen. (Its decent and good for use) \n6, The flip cart service is so good, got the phone in 3 days, safe and sound(don't expect headphone with the box).    \nOver all Asus outdone itself by providing us a phone with unlimited spec and excellent built quality in an affordable price range.

This is a hands-on review after using it for couple of hours, so I don't know about any long term disadvantages.  \nFirst of all, it has got quite good looks for a phone this cheap. The black version, which I ordered, is gorgeous and in no way does it look like a cheap phone. You have my word on this. Also, The back cover is matte and scratch resistance. \nThe screen is not Gorilla Glass and is very highly reflective. So you always see reflection while using it, which is very annoying while gaming or watching videos. (I would suggest going for matte finish screen guard). Also the LCD is a little sunken from the main touch screen.The automatic brightness control is good but for such a reflective screen you have to use the manual controls to keep the brightness a little high. Overall the screen is one of the cons and the first thing that reminds you that this is a cheap phone. \nThe ZenUI is just amazing. Best UI i've seen after Sony. I have used Zenfone 4 and 5 and ZenUI is just as awesome as before. There are some changes like the Reading Mode (gives the screen a yellow-ish tint) is missing. \nThe camera is 5 MP on 4:3 ratio pictures. For those who click photos on 16:9 ratio (almost everyone), it is actually 4 MP. The outdoor picture quality is good and seeing the price, you could hardly get any better. The indoor quality varies according to the amount of lighting, flash on/off and night mode (overall it's grainy and very average). The front camera is disappointing and barely usable. \nThe sound quality is extraordinarily good. I mean it's excellent for this price bracket. I have used much more expensive phones than this, and most of them disappointed in all ways. It might not be able to go too loud, but while most phones have shrill trebles, this phone gives an amazing range of bass too. Overall, its crystal clear (no tearing) and gives the full range of trebles and bass. \nIt does have heating problem sometimes, and many people concern themselves with it, but it's really is not a problem until it becomes very extremely hot. This is one other con and the second thing that remind you this is a cheap phone. \nBattery is running okay and quite good for an android phone. Although the phone does take more time to charge than other phones.  \nAlthough it most certainly won't give you the feel of a high end phone, it remains very worthy of the price in most aspects. If it's good for you, that you have to decide.  \nNote: This is a hands-on review so I haven't written anything about connectivity problems, internet usage, benchmarks, or any problems that might manifest in the long run.

I fall in love at first sight. \n[my rating=10/10]   \nDisplay: 4.5inch big screen is good with 854 x 480 Pixels. Even In sunlight display is good enough. \n[my rating=8/10]   \nSound: Call sound is fair enough and loudspeaker is also clear and good, but can be better. \n[my rating=7/10]   \nBattery: Battery drains like hell. I think it is not a 2100mah one. \n.[my rating=4/10]   \nCamera: 5Mp Camera is not that good. All that 'Pixel Muster Technology' is a marketing Gimmick. But, 'Low light Mode' helps a lot. So many new and exciting camera features are there. In Night pictures gets noisy. In daylight they are okay. Color producing is not great though. Front is VGA. Am not going to talk about it. Not worth of talking. \n [my rating=6/10]   \nZEN UI: ZEN UI is a fresh air. Some new features are there. Really friendly to use. But, It's drains the battery.

I don't find any lagging, even while playing high graphics games like Asphalt 8. \n[my rating=8/10]   \nOthers: i)Have a LED notification with cool Red and Green led. \nii)ZEN UI have too many new features to explore. \niii) There's a personal assistance called &quot;Whats Next&quot;. I really like this.   \nMain Problems: i)In night pictures gets Noisy(camera Bug). \nii)Overheating while browsing, playing games, YouTub(ING). \niii)Restarts sometimes. \niv)Some bugs in Music Player. \nv) Battery drains quick. \nvi) Bluetooth problem   \nNote: I find an issue with Bluetooth. This phone can not receive file via Bluetooth simultaneously. After the second file received, when third file cones, Zenfone C automatically Discards it. I visited ASUS's service center then.

In terms of ergonomics, the phone is quite large to fit in your hands.The volume buttons are nicely placed on the back below the camera module. The power button is oddly placed on the top but is not that difficult to use (although you have the option to tap the screen to unlock). There are three capacitive buttons below the display which offers tactile feedback but are non-backlit. The Asus logo lies just below the earpiece. The earphone slot is at the top along with the noise cancellation mic and the power button. With 3.9mm thickness at the edges, it provides you a good grip.At the back lies the camera with a dual tone flash above it and also the loudspeaker at the bottom.   \n2. USER INTERFACE \nZenfone 2 comes with Zen UI. The interface looks beautiful and is customizable to a huge extent. But the UI is not stable as of yet, it has a quite a lot of bugs.The good thing is Asus is providing a lot of updates to make it bug free. Despite being heavily customized, the UI doesn't make the phone sluggish, thanks to its 4GB RAM. What I liked the most about the UI is that every single application ( like default camera,music player,dialer) can be updated from the playstore. With this the app doesn't only get better but also gets new features. If the update is not to to your liking, you can always uninstall the updates.   \n3. CAMERA \nThe ZenFone 2 uses a 13 megapixel Toshiba senor at the back.The same sensor is also used by many mid range Lumia models. It is just that the Asus didn't find the correct algorithm to get the best out of the camera module. The images are sometimes undersaturated under daylight and over exposed under artificial lighting conditions. The front camera takes decent selfies. A lot has improved after the two system updates. The camera quality is good now but is not at par with Mi4 and One plus one. The software enhancements provided by Asus with its pixelmaster camera are excellent. One can tweak with the many modes provided along with the manual mode to get the best shot. Lowlight mode does match up to its hype. It can click pictures in such darkness that it would put high end phones to shame. The output it delivers in low light mode doesn't have accurate colors and appears a bit grainy but it still shows up with an image where most other phones will fail too. The 'depth of field' mode focusses the subject and blurs the other objects. It works good to some extent but needs improvement. Hopefully Asus will provide further updates.   \n4. SOUND \nThe sound output is really low on loudspeaker. Although the speaker grills are relatively large on the back, the output is not at all loud. The sound doesn't get muffled, thanks to its curvy back. While on earphones the experience is entirely different. The output is loud and delivers a good quality even at high volumes. The surround sound effect is excellent and the bass levels are good.   \n5. DISPLAY \nZenFone 2 comprises of a full HD IPS panel. The colors are good but not as good as any AMOLED displays. The display is not very bright and is slightly on the dull side. The viewing angles are good. There are various modes to choose from and you can even set your own saturation levels. The display performa best under the vivid mode and legibility under sunlight is good.   \n6.BATTERY \nDespite packing a powerful 3000mAh battery, it fails to last a day. With moderate usage, it lasts around 12 hours. As the phone comes with Lollipop 5.0, battery issues are bound to happen. Hope the battery issue gets fixed with the next upgrade.   \n7.PERFORMANCE \nIn terms of performance, this phone is a beast. It can handle anything you throw at it. With 4GB of RAM, you can run twenty odd applications simultaneously with ease. I didn't notice any lag till now in my usage.   \n8. OTHERS \nCall reception quality is good.App gets crashed at times since the UI is not stable as I mentioned earlier.   \nOverall a good buy at this price but definitely not comparable to any of the flagship models.

The front camera is good for selfies in bright light, don't expect more. Abiding by other reviewers it has its drawback, U can live with it, no serious ones in the below list, \n1, The phone heats up while in charging (because of the fast charging technology, don't try to attend longer calls in charging , it heats up your ear, the processor is near to the listening speaker ),  \n2, Sound quality is good and neat, fine for voice calls, cant play loud music. \n3, The battery discharge is like 8.5% to 9% per hour in idle mode with WiFi or mobile data on, and 12 to 15 % per hour in continuous all around daily usage for me.

Fast processing times. Very easy to use especially with the tiles. Very intuitive. Does what it says on the tin. Great camera and well worth the money!  \nCons \nPoor app store experience \nFeels a little flimsy. On/off button could be more robust. Heavy user so will see how long it lasts. My previous phone was a Lumia and the on/off but stopped working after a year. However this is a great phone with a lot of kit for the money.   \nreview :- \nThe main selling point of the Lumia 640 is that it shows off the best features of the Windows mobile ecosystem, which includes Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enterprise tools.  \nThe Lumia 640 has a 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad-core processor with 1GB RAM, which is becoming standard for affordable mobiles these days. It means that it handles everyday operations without much bother, but does experience a little lag when trying to open apps and select options. The 640 does well with 3D games, too. We put it through its paces playing the frenetic Asphalt 8: Airborne and it had no issues. The gameplay was uninterrupted and fast, despite the graphics lacking the smoothness you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get from a more capable top-tier phone    \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting to see HD screens become more common in the mid-range price bracket, which is a fantastic thing. The Lumia 640 enters the fray with a 5-inch 720 x 1280-resolution (294ppi) IPS LCD screen with quality that would be impressive on a phone costing twice the price.  \nThe screen does a decent job of representing colours accurately, avoiding the colour casting that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen on other phones such as the very cheap Lumia 435. Comparing it to a higher-end phone such as the Samsung Galaxy Alpha, which costs over \u00c2\u00a3200 more, it holds up quite well. Used outdoors on a bright day the Lumia 640\u00e2\u0080\u0099s screen is visible, albeit a little on the dark side. Putting the brightness up to \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh\u00e2\u0080\u009d doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do a great deal to solve the issue either. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching any dark videos you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll really struggle to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on.  \nMicrosoft Lumia 640 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Design &amp; Features \nAt a glance, the Microsoft Lumia 640 is almost indistinguishable from the Nokia Lumia 630/635, but the 640\u00e2\u0080\u0099s translucent plastic back gives it a fresher feel.  \nIn keeping with the trend for bigger phones the Lumia 640 has a larger 5-inch screen, up from 4.5 inches. The additional screen size has made the 640 a little taller and wider, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually slimmer, at 8.8mm thick. On the whole this phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s design stays in typical Lumia territory. The phone, covered in smooth plastic and Gorilla Glass 3 on its screen, feels good to hold and is comfortable enough to use one-handed.  \nThe back cover of the Lumia 640 can be easily removed to reveal the phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s replaceable 2500mAh battery along with a micro-SIM and microSD slots. The extra storage is vital, given that the phone has only 8GB of built-in memory, with almost 2GB of that taken up by pre-installed apps. Fortunately the expansion slot supports cards up to 128GB, which will be more than enough for most people.  \nWe like how tough and well made the 640 feels. Its sturdy construction makes it a phone that we could use confidently without worrying about the odd bump.

This review is solely from the perspective of Lumia 640:  \nI will only mention the features i don't like as there are already umpteen reviews on the phone which go gaga over its features:    \n 1. Network Issue: It definitely has network issues and microsoft should look into it if it wants to remain in competition with Andriod/Apple. You can download data and use internet, using 3g sim, only if the signal is H+. Otherwise you have to use a wifi. But how can people from small cities have wifi around them 24X7. I have never seen a phone before which cannot download data on H signal. Pathetic. For those from small cities who surf on mobiles a lot, be careful.  \n2. Accessories: Microsoft is kidding with the customers when it comes to earphone and other accessories, you cannot skip a laugh when you see it. Secondly they should have provided usb cable. This is a drawback when you sell a phone near 9-10K.  \n3 Appstore: I could not find the app of my bank. It was really disappointing. I am not a app-lover. But the store really is lacking.  \n4. Size: When i saw it on flipkart and on youtube, the size looks big. But when i opened the box , i was surprised. It is a drawback for those who want to read newspaper, ebooks on it. For first time smartphone buyers who does not have much idea about phone sizes Xiaomi 4g note 2 is better option at this price range. But considering this is a phone and not tablet/laptop i can live up with it.  \n5. At times i noticed phone rebooting itself.it is not acceptable in the market. I was about to return the product to flipkart . BUT suddenly microsoft sent an update which stopped the self-rebooting problem.   \nSo if you can still live up with all the shortcomings mentioned above,you can go ahead and buy the phone, rest everything is good.    \nYou can see that i am given 4 start to the phone, it means that i am satisfied with it. I am also excited like everyone else for forthcoming windows 10 update. I hope Microsoft will resolve some issues.  \nHats off to Flipkart to deliver the product within 48 hours, as promised, in a tier 3 city like mine. It was really surprising. There is no online shopping store as fast and reliable as flipkart.     "], ["Proloy Chakrob...", "Excellent Phone at Great Price ", "\n Using this mobile for 3 weeks.

Heats a bit (not so intense) while using internet, but only when the ambient temperature is little higher than room temperature, otherwise you can not feel any heat at all even after hours of intense usage..  \nBut there are certain things that I would like to share with all of you...  \nFlipkart delivery &amp; Service: It took them 8 days to deliver the product (little late for flipkart's reputation). I have ordered two Lumia 640s and one of them was defective (did not power on). Booked a complaint and they replaced it in 2 days. And after that I never got a chance to call them again regarding any issues, Coz there weren't any..    \nProduct:- \n Slim build, the black version has matte black back cover. Not so slippery, but I always felt like dropping it. So I put a flip cover for extra grip and safety. Side buttons are firm and tight.    \nDisplay: 5 inch HD screen is crystal clear. Corning gorilla glass is superb (which is not there in Lumia 540). Plays HD videos smoothly wiithout any lag. Double-tap to wake feature is good so you don't have to push the power button more often. Double tap on the navigation bar to lock the phone is also there.    \nSpeaker &amp; headphones :Loudspeaker is Loud enough. over the average performance. Head phones are cheap. they have put the same headphones with it as they give with other Rs 1500 phones. you have to buy a good headphone to go along with your Lumia.    \nCamera: Rear 8 MP shooter is excellent. I have compared the quality with Mi 4i, Moto G 2nd gen, Samsung Galaxy core prime, and some other phone in 10k range. This one beats them all. Supports 1080p HD recording with amazing clarity. \n Front 0.9 MP camera(performs better that 3 MP cams) is much better than the above mentioned phones. You can shoot selfies. video quality with the cam is really good.    \nApps &amp; Games:- Windows phone store has most of the apps that you can find in google store. But some apps lack many features as they have in android platform. But that's ok for average users like me. Low end games like Subway Surfers, Temple Run run super smooth. I have not played any heavy games yet.    \nSensors: All the sensors work perfectly.. except I felt the magnetometer a little dis-oriented. (a particular direction, say North, is shifted about 10-15 degrees on the compass when you rotate the phone to other direction, wherein the 'N' should always point to the North irrespective of your phone's orientation)    \nConnectivity: Internet on 2G, 3G, Wi-fi are excellent. Voice call quality is perfect. No issues in this section. No USB data cable provided in the box.    \nBattery: Battery lasts 24 - 36 hours for me (4 hours of watching 720p HD movies, 20 mins of 2G voice call, 3 hours on 2G internet, 1 hour of low end gaming, listening to music for around 1 hour and casual usage of the phone). I am not a heavy user. but it should run you a around 18 hours with heavy use. Charging time is 3 hours 10% to 100% whit the default charger.   \n CONCLUSION: I am fully satisfied with the phone. I had only one issue with it in 1st week of use. It frequently hanged with a white screen while using internet. I backed up my data and and performed a 'Hard Reset' and everything was back to normal.. \n I shall recommend this phone to everyone who want a really good smartphone under Rs10,000..    \n 1 star deducted due to cheap headphone, no data cable and the magnetometer issue.. otherwise it's AWESOME...

I can see time, new message notifications, whether battery is charging or not without switching on the screen. \nThe Bad is at the end below.    \n- The Matt black back.  \nI love the black phone with matt black plastic back. It gives the phone a 'held back sophisticated' look (like wearing a black suite instead of bright blue one) - goes well in office settings.    \n- The detachable back and SD card support and music player \nFor around 1.5K I bought a 64GB microSD card and now I have a 64GB music player in my pocket always. Transferring my iTunes playlist was seamless (I was an iPod user earlier) using WindowsPhone app on my Mac.    \nNot happy about: \n- The charger!  \nThey decided to pack in a very lame battery charger. Usually mobile chargers are compact and have detachable USB cable, which you can detach and use it as data cable. For 640 they gave a biggish, three pronged charger which has old fashioned power cable permanently attached to it. I didn't end up using it - using a two pronged charger (which has detachable usb cable) from an old phone.    \n- Glance screen. \nFor some reason, Lumia decided to remove display of dates and detailed notification (example, the details - subject, time, place - of next appointment in your calendar) from Glance Screen. Its there in the older Lumia models but not in this new 640. \nThis was a big disappointment for me personally, but guess will not apply for everybody.  \nBut putting this info out there for the folks who are big user of Glance Screen.

I have compared this with some of the latest AMOLED android phones side by side and while keeping the phone at usual reading distance I could not feel any lack of resolution or ppi. Yes if we keep the phone at 5 - 10 cm from the face there may be some difference although very minute. Anyway I don't plan to use the phone so close to my face.iOS 8 runs like butter. Touch ID is the best fingerprint sensor in any smartphone. It is so accurate in allowing the right and denying the wrong fingers. 1 Gb RAM is the only slight disappointment in terms of specs on paper but I did not find any issues of crash or anything. I also tried opening 6 desktop view safari tabs. Then opening couple of other apps and games. Then came back to safari and none of these tabs refreshed or reloaded. I tried it e same test with 10 tabs and some of them reloaded.But I am anyway not such a heavy Multitasker. So it is not too much of a problem.

The ZenUI is very smooth and comes with good customization without them being to intrusive with the operating system.. \n6. The Micro SD card slot is very welcome to this segment of device. \n7.The battery backup is good and I could get through a day with average use and 2 hrs of gaming aswell. \n8. The value for money quotient is very high as you get much more of a device then we pay for.   \nCons   \n1. Tinny speakers with very low audio output. \n2. The camera could've been better.

Display - with wide viewing angles, the display is very bright and vibrant.   \nThats all Pros you can talk about this phone.   \nCons -  \n1. Biggest drawback is Hive UI. They should have stuck to stock android. The ambient display setting if turned on will just lit up the lock screen without showing any notifications. It becomes annoying after a while. Coming from a Moto G phone, where ambient display means display notifications in light color I found it very odd to have setting which doesn't serve its purpose. \n2. No notifications on lockscreen. Whats the point? Even older android versions had that. \n3. Camera - 13+2? It doesn't even take 8 mp quality pics. The dual camera is just limited to refocus and few other effects after the photo has been taken. The images have darker shade. Front camera has 2 mp quality. \n4. Sim tray - Its very tedious to fit the sim and sd card.  \n5. No gallery app. \n6. Lag - it lags a lot while scrolling on web pages and images. Games cannot be run at a high setting. \n7. Low earpiece volume. \n8. Network issues - There is frequent network drops while on calling and standby. I have tested the same sim on my other phone. \n9.

Below is the list of pros and cons from my usage of the phone in the past week or so. Lets start with the Pros   \nPros -  \n1. Looks - Yes it looks great with CGL 3 on both sides.  \n2. Display - with wide viewing angles, the display is very bright and vibrant.   \nThats all Pros you can talk about this phone.   \nCons -  \n1. Biggest drawback is Hive UI. They should have stuck to stock android. The ambient display setting if turned on will just lit up the lock screen without showing any notifications. It becomes annoying after a while. Coming from a Moto G phone, where ambient display means display notifications in light color I found it very odd to have setting which doesn't serve its purpose. \n2. No notifications on lockscreen. Whats the point? Even older android versions had that. \n3. Camera - 13+2? It doesn't even take 8 mp quality pics. The dual camera is just limited to refocus and few other effects after the photo has been taken. The images have darker shade. Front camera has 2 mp quality. \n4. Sim tray - Its very tedious to fit the sim and sd card.  \n5. No gallery app. \n6. Lag - it lags a lot while scrolling on web pages and images. Games cannot be run at a high setting. \n7. Low earpiece volume. \n8. Network issues - There is frequent network drops while on calling and standby. I have tested the same sim on my other phone. \n9. Slippery back - It slips a lot due to CG 3 glass at the rear.   \n2 stars that I have given is for looks and display.

Intel processor combined with 2 GB RAM provides for a very smooth experience. 16 GB internal storage makes sure that one doesn't run out of storage space. The camera is very good except for the fact that in low light there is colour distortion which is significant only in night mode ie when you want to take pics in about complete darkness. In all other cases it works brilliantly. THE PHONE HAS SERIOUS OVERHEATING ISSUES. After about just 10 mins of video call on 3G the phone becomes so hot that one can't even hold it properly. I get the feeling that multi tasking leads to over heating on this device. 3G speed is really good. So is Wi Fi. FM connectivity is good with other company's headsets. The phone has non removable battery but that has not been an issue for me till now. Auto Brightness works well. Now let me come to the battery part. ASUS, SERIOUSLY??? How can you be so dumb so as to give such a weak battery??? I assure you with moderate calling you will return home with a dead battery. You won't be able to enjoy movies or listen to music because of the fear of running out of battery. If you are a heavy user then don't even consider this phone. You will regret it all the time. On normal standby mode with dual sim the rate of discharge is about 4 - 5 % per hour. That means without even making a single call this device will not give a standby time of even 24 hours.

The display is IPS grade screen with the best resolution colour reproduction that I have seen in any set under 20000. One may even like to compare it with IPhone's Retina display standard. \n2. The basic function is calling, so here also it scores pretty good. I mean voice clarity is good ( may not be the best atleast, I have tested on Reliance GSM).  \n3. High Speed internet experience is very good. Really enjoyed the experience. \n4. Regarding display here is also another point to mention in all other smartphones in the 5&quot; IPS display category most of the manufacturers have put digital touch buttons on the screen as such although having 5&quot; screen the user gets only around 4.5&quot; - 4.7&quot; not the full 5&quot;. \n6. There is radio. But the radio quality is around average. \n7. The music player is there with several customizations. To have the best sound experience I would recommend either download a better player, or customize the sound equalizer. I have customized the sound equalizer and getting sound with quality and clarity of that of the Sony walkman series. I love the music.To the complement the sound jacks provided (please readjust the earbuds provided to have the best fit in the ears) are really good. \n8. The camera primary as well as secondary are super. Amazingly it can click MACRO quality images (with apparture 2.0 to 2.8, by default its 2.8). Normal photography may be compared to any 13mp sensor. Its very good. There are other modes too. Please check these modes over youtube. You can find easily. \nInfact the camera sensor is that of sony. \nThere is an Image stabilization for photos as well as videos. The phone can easily record video at 1920x1080 at 30 fps. \n9. The game quality is very good. Yesterday I have checked it with Modern combat 5 as well as asphalt 8. Both ran smoothly. Infact to test its RAM management I kept both games running and jumped between the 2 using the multitasking button around 3 times. No lag was there. Infact the colour reproduction for each frames was super with the full 5&quot; display support. \n10. Regarding multi-tasking tested with 20 opened apps (Non- gaming general apps) no lag was there. It is a fine experience. \n11. For all those who are complaining about the battery please see the settings. Actually when the phone is stated all the power consuming services are on. Please adjust the app configurations. I mean when you are not using data connections stop the auto sync etc. Infact asus has provide in the phone the power saving mode use this mode. Infact I have configured this and getting a backup comparable to that of MOTO G. \n12. I have tested the phone in Atuntu banchmark today. The score that I got is 23096.   \nCons: \nBattery backup is not very good. But could be increased by deep sleep mode.

I have no idea what it did. It didn't update the ROM. I am hating Google apps for this reason.

"], ["Ankit", "Want to try your luck with this phone then go for it...!! ", "\n I purchased this phone on 25 th April 2015 in a sale. Initially i was very exciting that i bought Samsung s5 flagship Phone in just 20699 RS. I got the phone on time from Flipkart. After getting the phone i started doing setup and i realize that there was some problem in the phone as the Phone Heated more than Normal temperature.   \nAfter using the phone for next 2 days i actually feel that i purchased a heater rather than a Mobile. I also went to Samsung service center and they checked my mobile with a heating gun and My Mobile temperature was 40 degree at the service center with normal use. They told me that according to company norms mobile is ok with upto 47 degree temperature.   \nThen i request Flipkart for exchanging the Phone but they refused to do that but after many request they agree to replace my phone.   \nAnd one more thing there is creaking sound in my mobile phone from back side.   \nAfter few days i finally get the new replacement mobile which is as new as my first mobile.   \nMy second mobile also heats up but less than from my first mobile. My second mobile heats up from right panel of the mobile and it is very uncomfortable to hold the device.   \nAnd creaking sound was also there in my second mobile.   \nThen i again request flipkart to return my mobile and they rejected my request.   \nAfter few days my mobile screen was flickering and then i visited samsung service center, they asked me to droped the phone there for checking purpose. And they told me that it will take 7-15 days to repair the phone. I refused to drop the phone there.   \nThen I called flipkart for returning the phone and they checked my phone with there smart check app and they found screen problem in the phone and they finally return my phone.   \nFlipkart is a Saviour in my case.   \nAt present time it is very difficult to choose a mobile. Initially we have to try our luck in Chinese local phone and at that time we will go blindly with any samsung or Nokia brands mobile.   \nBut Now, a days we have to try our luck with branded phone also.   \nTill date i waiting for a non heating Phone.

"], ["Dipankar Ganguly", "Good deal at 23K ", "\n PROS: \n# AN EXCELLENT DISPLAY: Still standing tall even after 1 year of its release, packs an incredibly sharp display at 432 ppi good color reproduction &amp; high contrast ratio, coupled with some tweakings at the settings. The new Galaxy S6 has 577 ppi with a 2K display but given the fact that our eyes can`t differentiate anything above 400 ppi, that`s unnecessary.   \n# DECENT CAMERA: The 16mp shooter works pretty fine at daylight. Results are outstanding with excellent details. 4K video recording is a nice addon with xtra features of high fps shooting modes.   \n# SAMSUNG SPECIAL FEATURES: Power saving mode which turns the phone gray scale works like a charm. You can use it even without enabling the ULTRA SAVING MODE and the phone performs as it is with normal functions in grayscale mode. Saves quite a lot of juice. \nAlso the S health, air view, air gestures works as expected but are a kind of gimmick to some, as normal users won't be using them much.   \n# BATTERY LIFE: Battery life is decent and I easily manage to get a days use with moderate tasking. Phone gets hot while charging but thats completely normal.   \n# MULTI-TASKING AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE: With Adonis Prime2 SoC from the house of Samsung, two Quads clocked at 1.9 and 1.3 Ghz and heterogenous processing which enables the use of all the eight cores at once, performance is satisfactory. The available RAM is less as 1.2/2.0 GB is being eaten up by the system (I am using lollipop) heavy multi tasking might lead to stuttering but day to day activities are buttery smooth on the device.   \n# SENSORS &amp; FUNCTIONALITIES: The device packing plethora of sensors comes pretty handy at times with IR blaster etc. The heart sensor though is not that accurate but its there as an addon. \nThe swipe based Fingerprint sensor, again not at all upto the mark of the Apples`s implementation in its iPhones but got a lot better with the lollipop update. One can refer to lot of youtube videos that help how to improve the accuracy of the fingerprint sensor working   \n# REMOVABLE BATTERY &amp; SD CARD EXPANSION: Nowadays with all the flagship phones doing away with these, But I personally feel better when I have a user swappable battery &amp; a microSD card slot to go with my device. Using a Class 10 card is recommended for optimum performance.   \n# SOFTWARE UPDATES: Given the age of the device, it should be eligible to receive the Android M update too and this should keep ur ph updated for another one year atleast.   \nCONS: \n* No USB 3.0 cable. The phone is equipped with USB 3.0 port but it's a shame from Samsung's part not to ship with a 3.0 cable with it.   \n* POOR RAM MANAGEMENT: Out of available 2GB around 1.3 GB is already used up by the System &amp; pre installed apps. So heavy multitasking without a lag is not guaranteed and it's a shame given it was the flagship phone of 2014 priced at a whooping Rs 51K in India.   \n* CONFUSING &amp; RESOURCE INTENSIVE TOUCHWIZ UI: Touchwiz though it's jam packed with tons of features &amp; utilities, it does comes for a price of ur precious resources. Touchwiz interface at kitkat in Galaxy S5 is confusing. Lollipop improved it though.   \nVERDICT: \nLaunched at Rs 51K at April 2014 it was certainly not worth that price at that time but now I managed to get it at 21.5K, its absolutely a steal deal and probably the best smartphone u can get within 23K budget. The chinese manufacturers r doing well but with no proper promise of after sales services. Galaxy S5, though not a perfect device, but at 23K price point, benefits do outweigh the risks.

Great camera and well worth the money!  \nCons \nPoor app store experience \nFeels a little flimsy. On/off button could be more robust. Heavy user so will see how long it lasts. My previous phone was a Lumia and the on/off but stopped working after a year. However this is a great phone with a lot of kit for the money.   \nreview :- \nThe main selling point of the Lumia 640 is that it shows off the best features of the Windows mobile ecosystem, which includes Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enterprise tools.  \nThe Lumia 640 has a 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad-core processor with 1GB RAM, which is becoming standard for affordable mobiles these days. It means that it handles everyday operations without much bother, but does experience a little lag when trying to open apps and select options. The 640 does well with 3D games, too. We put it through its paces playing the frenetic Asphalt 8: Airborne and it had no issues. The gameplay was uninterrupted and fast, despite the graphics lacking the smoothness you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get from a more capable top-tier phone    \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting to see HD screens become more common in the mid-range price bracket, which is a fantastic thing. The Lumia 640 enters the fray with a 5-inch 720 x 1280-resolution (294ppi) IPS LCD screen with quality that would be impressive on a phone costing twice the price.  \nThe screen does a decent job of representing colours accurately, avoiding the colour casting that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen on other phones such as the very cheap Lumia 435. Comparing it to a higher-end phone such as the Samsung Galaxy Alpha, which costs over \u00c2\u00a3200 more, it holds up quite well. Used outdoors on a bright day the Lumia 640\u00e2\u0080\u0099s screen is visible, albeit a little on the dark side. Putting the brightness up to \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh\u00e2\u0080\u009d doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do a great deal to solve the issue either. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching any dark videos you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll really struggle to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on.  \nMicrosoft Lumia 640 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Design &amp; Features \nAt a glance, the Microsoft Lumia 640 is almost indistinguishable from the Nokia Lumia 630/635, but the 640\u00e2\u0080\u0099s translucent plastic back gives it a fresher feel.  \nIn keeping with the trend for bigger phones the Lumia 640 has a larger 5-inch screen, up from 4.5 inches. The additional screen size has made the 640 a little taller and wider, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually slimmer, at 8.8mm thick. On the whole this phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s design stays in typical Lumia territory. The phone, covered in smooth plastic and Gorilla Glass 3 on its screen, feels good to hold and is comfortable enough to use one-handed.  \nThe back cover of the Lumia 640 can be easily removed to reveal the phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s replaceable 2500mAh battery along with a micro-SIM and microSD slots. The extra storage is vital, given that the phone has only 8GB of built-in memory, with almost 2GB of that taken up by pre-installed apps. Fortunately the expansion slot supports cards up to 128GB, which will be more than enough for most people.  \nWe like how tough and well made the 640 feels. Its sturdy construction makes it a phone that we could use confidently without worrying about the odd bump.

This review is solely from the perspective of Lumia 640:  \nI will only mention the features i don't like as there are already umpteen reviews on the phone which go gaga over its features:    \n 1. Network Issue: It definitely has network issues and microsoft should look into it if it wants to remain in competition with Andriod/Apple. You can download data and use internet, using 3g sim, only if the signal is H+. Otherwise you have to use a wifi. But how can people from small cities have wifi around them 24X7. I have never seen a phone before which cannot download data on H signal. Pathetic. For those from small cities who surf on mobiles a lot, be careful.  \n2. Accessories: Microsoft is kidding with the customers when it comes to earphone and other accessories, you cannot skip a laugh when you see it. Secondly they should have provided usb cable. This is a drawback when you sell a phone near 9-10K.  \n3 Appstore: I could not find the app of my bank. It was really disappointing. I am not a app-lover. But the store really is lacking.  \n4. Size: When i saw it on flipkart and on youtube, the size looks big. But when i opened the box , i was surprised. It is a drawback for those who want to read newspaper, ebooks on it. For first time smartphone buyers who does not have much idea about phone sizes Xiaomi 4g note 2 is better option at this price range. But considering this is a phone and not tablet/laptop i can live up with it.  \n5. At times i noticed phone rebooting itself.it is not acceptable in the market. I was about to return the product to flipkart . BUT suddenly microsoft sent an update which stopped the self-rebooting problem.   \nSo if you can still live up with all the shortcomings mentioned above,you can go ahead and buy the phone, rest everything is good.    \nYou can see that i am given 4 start to the phone, it means that i am satisfied with it. I am also excited like everyone else for forthcoming windows 10 update. I hope Microsoft will resolve some issues.  \nHats off to Flipkart to deliver the product within 48 hours, as promised, in a tier 3 city like mine. It was really surprising. There is no online shopping store as fast and reliable as flipkart.     "], ["Proloy Chakrob...", "Excellent Phone at Great Price ", "\n Using this mobile for 3 weeks.

", "\n I started using the phone on 22nd June. Till now no issues, running butter smooth. I have never noticed any lag. Heats a bit (not so intense) while using internet, but only when the ambient temperature is little higher than room temperature, otherwise you can not feel any heat at all even after hours of intense usage..  \nBut there are certain things that I would like to share with all of you...  \nFlipkart delivery &amp; Service: It took them 8 days to deliver the product (little late for flipkart's reputation). I have ordered two Lumia 640s and one of them was defective (did not power on). Booked a complaint and they replaced it in 2 days. And after that I never got a chance to call them again regarding any issues, Coz there weren't any..    \nProduct:- \n Slim build, the black version has matte black back cover. Not so slippery, but I always felt like dropping it. So I put a flip cover for extra grip and safety. Side buttons are firm and tight.    \nDisplay: 5 inch HD screen is crystal clear. Corning gorilla glass is superb (which is not there in Lumia 540). Plays HD videos smoothly wiithout any lag. Double-tap to wake feature is good so you don't have to push the power button more often. Double tap on the navigation bar to lock the phone is also there.    \nSpeaker &amp; headphones :Loudspeaker is Loud enough. over the average performance. Head phones are cheap. they have put the same headphones with it as they give with other Rs 1500 phones. you have to buy a good headphone to go along with your Lumia.    \nCamera: Rear 8 MP shooter is excellent. I have compared the quality with Mi 4i, Moto G 2nd gen, Samsung Galaxy core prime, and some other phone in 10k range. This one beats them all. Supports 1080p HD recording with amazing clarity. \n Front 0.9 MP camera(performs better that 3 MP cams) is much better than the above mentioned phones. You can shoot selfies. video quality with the cam is really good.    \nApps &amp; Games:- Windows phone store has most of the apps that you can find in google store. But some apps lack many features as they have in android platform. But that's ok for average users like me. Low end games like Subway Surfers, Temple Run run super smooth. I have not played any heavy games yet.    \nSensors: All the sensors work perfectly.. except I felt the magnetometer a little dis-oriented. (a particular direction, say North, is shifted about 10-15 degrees on the compass when you rotate the phone to other direction, wherein the 'N' should always point to the North irrespective of your phone's orientation)    \nConnectivity: Internet on 2G, 3G, Wi-fi are excellent. Voice call quality is perfect. No issues in this section. No USB data cable provided in the box.    \nBattery: Battery lasts 24 - 36 hours for me (4 hours of watching 720p HD movies, 20 mins of 2G voice call, 3 hours on 2G internet, 1 hour of low end gaming, listening to music for around 1 hour and casual usage of the phone). I am not a heavy user. but it should run you a around 18 hours with heavy use. Charging time is 3 hours 10% to 100% whit the default charger.   \n CONCLUSION: I am fully satisfied with the phone. I had only one issue with it in 1st week of use. It frequently hanged with a white screen while using internet. I backed up my data and and performed a 'Hard Reset' and everything was back to normal.. \n I shall recommend this phone to everyone who want a really good smartphone under Rs10,000..    \n 1 star deducted due to cheap headphone, no data cable and the magnetometer issue.. otherwise it's AWESOME...

Left home at 6AM in the morning, in a full day of use without charging - I made 3-4 calls for around 5-8 mins duration, used my mails and WhatsApp intermittently throughout the day - the battery was still showing at 70% when I returned back home at 11PM in the night.    \n- The call quality. Sounds are loud and clear to me and for the receiving party too.    \n- The screen. Quality screen - very readable and color looks vibrant. no problem in broad daylight and outdoors.    \n- Glance screen. This is both good and bad.  \nThe good part - one of the major reason for buying this phone was that it supports 'Glance Screen'. I can see time, new message notifications, whether battery is charging or not without switching on the screen. \nThe Bad is at the end below.    \n- The Matt black back.  \nI love the black phone with matt black plastic back. It gives the phone a 'held back sophisticated' look (like wearing a black suite instead of bright blue one) - goes well in office settings.    \n- The detachable back and SD card support and music player \nFor around 1.5K I bought a 64GB microSD card and now I have a 64GB music player in my pocket always. Transferring my iTunes playlist was seamless (I was an iPod user earlier) using WindowsPhone app on my Mac.    \nNot happy about: \n- The charger!  \nThey decided to pack in a very lame battery charger. Usually mobile chargers are compact and have detachable USB cable, which you can detach and use it as data cable. For 640 they gave a biggish, three pronged charger which has old fashioned power cable permanently attached to it. I didn't end up using it - using a two pronged charger (which has detachable usb cable) from an old phone.    \n- Glance screen. \nFor some reason, Lumia decided to remove display of dates and detailed notification (example, the details - subject, time, place - of next appointment in your calendar) from Glance Screen. Its there in the older Lumia models but not in this new 640. \nThis was a big disappointment for me personally, but guess will not apply for everybody.  \nBut putting this info out there for the folks who are big user of Glance Screen.

The gameplay was uninterrupted and fast, despite the graphics lacking the smoothness you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get from a more capable top-tier phone    \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting to see HD screens become more common in the mid-range price bracket, which is a fantastic thing. The Lumia 640 enters the fray with a 5-inch 720 x 1280-resolution (294ppi) IPS LCD screen with quality that would be impressive on a phone costing twice the price.  \nThe screen does a decent job of representing colours accurately, avoiding the colour casting that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen on other phones such as the very cheap Lumia 435. Comparing it to a higher-end phone such as the Samsung Galaxy Alpha, which costs over \u00c2\u00a3200 more, it holds up quite well. Used outdoors on a bright day the Lumia 640\u00e2\u0080\u0099s screen is visible, albeit a little on the dark side. Putting the brightness up to \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh\u00e2\u0080\u009d doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do a great deal to solve the issue either. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching any dark videos you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll really struggle to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on.  \nMicrosoft Lumia 640 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Design &amp; Features \nAt a glance, the Microsoft Lumia 640 is almost indistinguishable from the Nokia Lumia 630/635, but the 640\u00e2\u0080\u0099s translucent plastic back gives it a fresher feel.  \nIn keeping with the trend for bigger phones the Lumia 640 has a larger 5-inch screen, up from 4.5 inches. The additional screen size has made the 640 a little taller and wider, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually slimmer, at 8.8mm thick. On the whole this phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s design stays in typical Lumia territory. The phone, covered in smooth plastic and Gorilla Glass 3 on its screen, feels good to hold and is comfortable enough to use one-handed.  \nThe back cover of the Lumia 640 can be easily removed to reveal the phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s replaceable 2500mAh battery along with a micro-SIM and microSD slots. The extra storage is vital, given that the phone has only 8GB of built-in memory, with almost 2GB of that taken up by pre-installed apps. Fortunately the expansion slot supports cards up to 128GB, which will be more than enough for most people.  \nWe like how tough and well made the 640 feels. Its sturdy construction makes it a phone that we could use confidently without worrying about the odd bump.

This review is solely from the perspective of Lumia 640:  \nI will only mention the features i don't like as there are already umpteen reviews on the phone which go gaga over its features:    \n 1. Network Issue: It definitely has network issues and microsoft should look into it if it wants to remain in competition with Andriod/Apple. You can download data and use internet, using 3g sim, only if the signal is H+. Otherwise you have to use a wifi. But how can people from small cities have wifi around them 24X7. I have never seen a phone before which cannot download data on H signal. Pathetic. For those from small cities who surf on mobiles a lot, be careful.  \n2. Accessories: Microsoft is kidding with the customers when it comes to earphone and other accessories, you cannot skip a laugh when you see it. Secondly they should have provided usb cable. This is a drawback when you sell a phone near 9-10K.  \n3 Appstore: I could not find the app of my bank. It was really disappointing. I am not a app-lover. But the store really is lacking.  \n4. Size: When i saw it on flipkart and on youtube, the size looks big. But when i opened the box , i was surprised. It is a drawback for those who want to read newspaper, ebooks on it. For first time smartphone buyers who does not have much idea about phone sizes Xiaomi 4g note 2 is better option at this price range. But considering this is a phone and not tablet/laptop i can live up with it.  \n5. At times i noticed phone rebooting itself.it is not acceptable in the market. I was about to return the product to flipkart . BUT suddenly microsoft sent an update which stopped the self-rebooting problem.   \nSo if you can still live up with all the shortcomings mentioned above,you can go ahead and buy the phone, rest everything is good.    \nYou can see that i am given 4 start to the phone, it means that i am satisfied with it. I am also excited like everyone else for forthcoming windows 10 update. I hope Microsoft will resolve some issues.  \nHats off to Flipkart to deliver the product within 48 hours, as promised, in a tier 3 city like mine. It was really surprising. There is no online shopping store as fast and reliable as flipkart.     "], ["Proloy Chakrob...", "Excellent Phone at Great Price ", "\n Using this mobile for 3 weeks.

", "\n I started using the phone on 22nd June. Till now no issues, running butter smooth. I have never noticed any lag. Heats a bit (not so intense) while using internet, but only when the ambient temperature is little higher than room temperature, otherwise you can not feel any heat at all even after hours of intense usage..  \nBut there are certain things that I would like to share with all of you...  \nFlipkart delivery &amp; Service: It took them 8 days to deliver the product (little late for flipkart's reputation). I have ordered two Lumia 640s and one of them was defective (did not power on). Booked a complaint and they replaced it in 2 days. And after that I never got a chance to call them again regarding any issues, Coz there weren't any..    \nProduct:- \n Slim build, the black version has matte black back cover. Not so slippery, but I always felt like dropping it. So I put a flip cover for extra grip and safety. Side buttons are firm and tight.    \nDisplay: 5 inch HD screen is crystal clear. Corning gorilla glass is superb (which is not there in Lumia 540). Plays HD videos smoothly wiithout any lag. Double-tap to wake feature is good so you don't have to push the power button more often. Double tap on the navigation bar to lock the phone is also there.    \nSpeaker &amp; headphones :Loudspeaker is Loud enough. over the average performance. Head phones are cheap. they have put the same headphones with it as they give with other Rs 1500 phones. you have to buy a good headphone to go along with your Lumia.    \nCamera: Rear 8 MP shooter is excellent. I have compared the quality with Mi 4i, Moto G 2nd gen, Samsung Galaxy core prime, and some other phone in 10k range. This one beats them all. Supports 1080p HD recording with amazing clarity. \n Front 0.9 MP camera(performs better that 3 MP cams) is much better than the above mentioned phones. You can shoot selfies. video quality with the cam is really good.    \nApps &amp; Games:- Windows phone store has most of the apps that you can find in google store. But some apps lack many features as they have in android platform. But that's ok for average users like me. Low end games like Subway Surfers, Temple Run run super smooth. I have not played any heavy games yet.    \nSensors: All the sensors work perfectly.. except I felt the magnetometer a little dis-oriented. (a particular direction, say North, is shifted about 10-15 degrees on the compass when you rotate the phone to other direction, wherein the 'N' should always point to the North irrespective of your phone's orientation)    \nConnectivity: Internet on 2G, 3G, Wi-fi are excellent. Voice call quality is perfect. No issues in this section. No USB data cable provided in the box.    \nBattery: Battery lasts 24 - 36 hours for me (4 hours of watching 720p HD movies, 20 mins of 2G voice call, 3 hours on 2G internet, 1 hour of low end gaming, listening to music for around 1 hour and casual usage of the phone). I am not a heavy user. but it should run you a around 18 hours with heavy use. Charging time is 3 hours 10% to 100% whit the default charger.   \n CONCLUSION: I am fully satisfied with the phone. I had only one issue with it in 1st week of use. It frequently hanged with a white screen while using internet. I backed up my data and and performed a 'Hard Reset' and everything was back to normal.. \n I shall recommend this phone to everyone who want a really good smartphone under Rs10,000..    \n 1 star deducted due to cheap headphone, no data cable and the magnetometer issue.. otherwise it's AWESOME...

Left home at 6AM in the morning, in a full day of use without charging - I made 3-4 calls for around 5-8 mins duration, used my mails and WhatsApp intermittently throughout the day - the battery was still showing at 70% when I returned back home at 11PM in the night.    \n- The call quality. Sounds are loud and clear to me and for the receiving party too.    \n- The screen. Quality screen - very readable and color looks vibrant. no problem in broad daylight and outdoors.    \n- Glance screen. This is both good and bad.  \nThe good part - one of the major reason for buying this phone was that it supports 'Glance Screen'. I can see time, new message notifications, whether battery is charging or not without switching on the screen. \nThe Bad is at the end below.    \n- The Matt black back.  \nI love the black phone with matt black plastic back. It gives the phone a 'held back sophisticated' look (like wearing a black suite instead of bright blue one) - goes well in office settings.    \n- The detachable back and SD card support and music player \nFor around 1.5K I bought a 64GB microSD card and now I have a 64GB music player in my pocket always. Transferring my iTunes playlist was seamless (I was an iPod user earlier) using WindowsPhone app on my Mac.    \nNot happy about: \n- The charger!  \nThey decided to pack in a very lame battery charger. Usually mobile chargers are compact and have detachable USB cable, which you can detach and use it as data cable. For 640 they gave a biggish, three pronged charger which has old fashioned power cable permanently attached to it. I didn't end up using it - using a two pronged charger (which has detachable usb cable) from an old phone.    \n- Glance screen. \nFor some reason, Lumia decided to remove display of dates and detailed notification (example, the details - subject, time, place - of next appointment in your calendar) from Glance Screen. Its there in the older Lumia models but not in this new 640. \nThis was a big disappointment for me personally, but guess will not apply for everybody.  \nBut putting this info out there for the folks who are big user of Glance Screen.

It has it's own in built power saving software which pop ups a notification, if any of the apps are consuming more power. Pictures and video produced by the rear camera are great in quality.

"], ["Balaji Baskaran", "Great phone so far ", "\n After a lot of analysis on what to choose among Lenovo K3 Note, Huawei Honor 6 and Xiaomi Mi4i, I got Honor 6 last week. The points that I felt as positives when deciding to go for this mobile were: \n1. 5 inch screen. I am so annoyed with the huge screen size of the recent smart phones. I will be very happy to get a phone with under 5 inch screen size and having the performance as that of this mobile. But not left with many choices when we have to prefer performance over size.  \n2. Honor 6 was there in the market for around a year and let me tell you, this is one of the very few phones which maintained a 4+ rating through out (others being the very popular Moto Phones).  \n3. Premium Look of this phone.    \nNow coming to the pros and cons of this mobile after 1 week of usage: \n1. Display is excellent \n2. Phone is very light and slim and feels premium in hand \n3. Battery is excellent. I used to have wifi and 3G always turned on. I felt great seeing that remaining battery % around 30 even around 11 PM in the night after the mobile is plugged off from the charger at 8 AM.  \n4. Performance is great. 3 GB Ram and Octocore processor. What all apps I got rid of in my Moto G due to performance issues are running like cakewalk in this mobile and with 50% of capacity still left for use.  \n5. No heating issues so far. I was afraid that opting for performance might end up buying a heat bar as most of the octacore processors have reported heating issues. This mobile looks to be different. I have not felt any heating issues so far. I will keep looking for this aspect throughout my usage with this mobile.    \nCons: \n1. Now that dual sim has become the order of the day, this phone is single sim only. Comparing the other pros, this is nothing.    \nI am rating this one 5 stars based on usage for 1 week.

Sadly, the phone does not live up to even its reduced price. Within 3 days of usage, the phone started slowing down heavily quite often.   \nEven after we upgraded to Android Lollipop, the problem still continued. Did some research and found out that Samsung in India is putting its own Exynos processor in these phones but worldover it is providing the much better Snapdragon chipset. That explains a part of the issue.    \nAfter we put in in a return request, Flipkart asked us to speak to Samsung's customer care. Samsung phones do have a general tendency to slow down and hang. However, Samsung refused to accept that it is actually a problem. Infact they denied the return request without even bothering to physically inspect the handset. We were kind of not surprised as one of my friends had experienced the same earlier. Nevertheless we decided to keep the phone. It still slows down quite often to our frustration but I am going to leave it to your better judgement. Pros and Cons of the phone,as per my experience, are listed below.    \nPros: \n-Excellent Camera (Samsung knows the pulse point of the Indian consumer very well)   \n-Light and very comfortable to hold ( I also have a Samsung Note 3, which, due to its size, is not very comfortable to hold)   \n- Brilliant Screen    \n- Sound is crisp and clear enough as should be expected from a flagship phone.  \nCons   \n- Slow Speed: Possible due to Inferior Processor ( The phone will, at times, suck your last remaining bit of patience, especially when you need it the most. I had to capture some photographs of my friends and family on an outing but the phone decided to become a turtle and restarted on me several times. Gosh I wanted to kill it there and then.) So if you are a gamer, then you wont find much joy here unless you are still living in the Temple Run times.   \n- Battery - its not bad. Just plain average. Charging twice a day is a must ( I generally keep it on power saving ) But then almost every smartphone is like that, still it hurts when you buy the top flagship phone of last year.    \n- My phone is a white one (because it was the only colour they were offering on sale) and will get dirty even if do not touch it. But I guess, everyone uses phone covers, so shouldn't be a problem.    \nConclusion: In my humble opinion, price is attractive but NOT REALLY WORTH IT!

The desgin maybe not that impressive, but if you put in a good case, it will look amazing. \n2. True that Samsung Galaxy S5 doesn't support 4G LTE in India, but to say the truth; not every single place in India has 4G LTE network. And how many people actually use 4G LTE?  \n3. For the S5, Samsung ( lets say) introdusted a new processor. I mean, when the SnapDragon was introdusted there were negatives about it, but now most of the people can't adapt to a new processor. Just try to think it in a positive way. \n4. I know that the Heart Rate Senseor maybe something not useful to you, but it maybe useful to some other people.  \n5. I've seen a lot of comments about the fingerprint scanner, but Samsung was back then trying to push itself to a whole new level. One solution for the finger problem, just scan the same finger twice or even try times to make the scanning more accuret, or just STOP SWIPING YOUR FINGER FAST, AND JUST SLOWLY SWIPE IT!!!  \n* That is it about the Cons*   \nPros. \n1. It has a 5.1 inch sceen \n2. The phone is protected by Gorila Glass 3 \n3. Samsung introdusted The new TouchWiz UI on this phone \n4. Currently the phone can run v5.0, which is lolipop \n5. The Battery Life: If you compare the battery life between thhe latest Samsung Glaxy S seriers, S5 is having the best battary life. For example  \nA. S5: 2800 MaH  \nB. S6: 2550 MaH \nC. S6 Edge: 2600 MaH   \n6. the storage is upto 128 GB \n7. Samsung has brought advanced camera technology on the device, but it would have been better if the removed the Heart Rate Sensor and put in Optical Image Stabilization. \n8. S5 is having a lot of advatage by camera compared to all the latest Samsung Galaxy S and some Note phones. \n9. Samsung brought better security of the S5 \n10. S5 has the best working IR Blaster. ( Can work as a remote) \n11. It gives you about 50BG Dropbox storage. \n12. has a USB v3.0 for fast charging. \n13. And it has one of the best HDR now avalabile.   \nSo what I was trying to say was, this phone has only some downfalls, and for its current price, it is one of the best smartphones avalabile on the market.  \n* Please stop telling others not to by this phone, it is an amazing phone* "], ["Dishant Jain", "Phone becomes verh hot within 3-4 mins of use.

There are lot things you notice when you start using it. If you look at the technical specs as anyone would say, its awesome for this price. I would like to discuss the cons because, pros you can find anywhere and they are really good.   \nCons: \n1. The SIM 1 slot is very problematic. Not sure if it only for me. The Network signal is completely dropped and will never come back automatically until you restart. I use same Aircel connection in both the SIM slots, but SIM 2 is working fine most of the times. Because of this the 3G connection which is available only though SIM 1 cannot be used. \nStrange, but true as soon as I leave Chennai circle, SIM 1 does not work at all whatever work around I try. \n2. 3000 mah battery is just sufficient for a whole day use of 3g, whatsapp, atleast 3 hours of calling. Its is just ok not awesome. \n3. The keyboard space bar is very near to the home button , due to which you unknowingly tap the home button frequently. \n4. Battery drains faster when using wifi with full display brightness. \n5. While keeping in shirt pocket, the screen will turn on automatically even for slight shake during our normal walking and this will also lead to battery wastage. \n6.

The phone has non removable battery but that has not been an issue for me till now. Auto Brightness works well. Now let me come to the battery part. ASUS, SERIOUSLY??? How can you be so dumb so as to give such a weak battery??? I assure you with moderate calling you will return home with a dead battery.

", "\n I was excited with the specs of Asus Zenfone 2 when I first heard about it..and then was eagerly waiting for it to be on my palm. The specs, cost and the Red color attracted me most. So here is my feedback after using both the 2GB(16GB) and 4GB(32GB) ZE551ML versions.  \nLet's start with few critical points-  \n1. RAM - For 2GB RAM version, even after uninstalling all bloatwares possible and disabling all apps through Auto-start Manager, you end up having 600-700MB RAM most of the times. Sometimes, it gets down to 300-400MB too. Restarting the phone gets it up back to 800MB though. Even in 4GB RAM, most of the times you would get mostly around 2.2-2.3GB RAM. So, gist is, ZenUI packed OS eats up considerable RAM space, which is why I had to switch from 2GB to 4GB. Just to compare, my earlier phone Sony Xperia ZR with 2GB RAM, at any moment had more than 1GB RAM free, which was really great! Overall, I haven't seen any lagging while using in the 4GB versions, though a little bit on 2GB versions, but thats pretty marginal and for few seconds only.  \n2. Battery - 3000Mh sounds pretty heavy, however it doesn't perform up to the expectations though. With wifi on and 30 mins of gaming/streaming, the batter % goes down 1% almost every minute. So, if you start with 100%, after 30 minutes of heavy usage you'll end up with battery strength at close to 70%. But, in sleep mode, it stays pretty well. Also, with Asus boost charging available with 4GB versions, it really helps to have the phone fully charged within 80-90 minutes.  \n3. Display - Just about okay, works fine with me though didn't find it as gorgeous as my Sony Xperia ZR. Somehow, I feel display isn't bad for sure but could have been a bit better, overall with Full HD view.  \n4. Camera - I am not an expert, but this one is good enough for me with lots of betterment and customization modes, probably better than my Sony Xperia ZR (surprisingly, yes!). But, there are people who might not have been satisfied with the camera, so it comes down to individual opinions, which may differ.  \n5. Design and Look - The Red one looks really awesome and attractive! The design is pretty good too, ensuring I feel comfortable holding a 5.5inch screen on my comparatively smaller hands. Perhaps, I would have liked the regular positions of the volume control and screen lock buttons at the side instead of back and top respectively.  \n6. Speakers - Just about fine with it so far though could have been a bit louder. Speakers inside is actually smaller than the outlet shows on the back. Surprisingly, Bass boosting and Surround sound is available only in earphone/headphone mode, thats a negative in my book.  \n7. Sim - Though it's a Dual Sim phone, the second Sim slot will work only in 2G mode and can't connect to Internet. So, disappointed with it.  \n8. Flipkart - In case you have bought any phone and willing to return/exchange for any reason within 30 days, I suppose you won't get it. Because, for Flipkart it has to be a techincal fault to agree to return/replace it just being overall unsatisfied isn't enough. Though the delivery service is as usual great, but the after sales service is degrading day-by-day. So, guys, think again if you want to replace in particular costly mobile phones.  \nAs far as the phone is concerned, this is absolute beauty of a phone with great specs, price, design, looks and charger with few 'just-short-of-expectations' observations. Definitely, I would recommend everyone to consider this one particularly for daily-users willing to have a high specs yet cost saving phone.

Best choice I could have made "], ["Anil Kumar Panda", "I love this Color... ", "\n On this price it's a big deal from Asus.

Nexus 6 is a huge phone and to power this beast we have an approximately 3000mAH battery that drains pretty fast during the day. Phone gets heated up if you use camera for more than 15-20 mins. Didn't notice any heating issues with normal WiFi/3G browsing. Compared to other phones in the same price range (Sony Xperia Z3, HTC or iPhone), Nexus 6 still has a decent rating on the battery performance side also. AMOLED display is amazing and quite sensitive. Nexus 6 houses stereo speakers and in performance beats the iPhone 6 on audio boost. Although the pixel density is bit higher, this is no match to any iPhone. You immediately get Android upgrades from Google, so dont have to wait for a very long time. Nexus 6 has a 3GB RAM which is amazing in terms of amount of multitasking you can do and the number of background sessions you can keep open. Normal usage of the RAM is less than 1GB. In extreme cases when I opened many tabs in Chrome, 3 shopping Apps simultaneously and playing movie on Youtube, I noticed a significant usage in RAM up all the way to 2.5GB or so, still this is the best in this price range.

This is a hands-on review after using it for couple of hours, so I don't know about any long term disadvantages.  \nFirst of all, it has got quite good looks for a phone this cheap. The black version, which I ordered, is gorgeous and in no way does it look like a cheap phone. You have my word on this. Also, The back cover is matte and scratch resistance. \nThe screen is not Gorilla Glass and is very highly reflective. So you always see reflection while using it, which is very annoying while gaming or watching videos. (I would suggest going for matte finish screen guard). Also the LCD is a little sunken from the main touch screen.The automatic brightness control is good but for such a reflective screen you have to use the manual controls to keep the brightness a little high. Overall the screen is one of the cons and the first thing that reminds you that this is a cheap phone. \nThe ZenUI is just amazing. Best UI i've seen after Sony. I have used Zenfone 4 and 5 and ZenUI is just as awesome as before. There are some changes like the Reading Mode (gives the screen a yellow-ish tint) is missing. \nThe camera is 5 MP on 4:3 ratio pictures. For those who click photos on 16:9 ratio (almost everyone), it is actually 4 MP. The outdoor picture quality is good and seeing the price, you could hardly get any better. The indoor quality varies according to the amount of lighting, flash on/off and night mode (overall it's grainy and very average). The front camera is disappointing and barely usable. \nThe sound quality is extraordinarily good. I mean it's excellent for this price bracket. I have used much more expensive phones than this, and most of them disappointed in all ways. It might not be able to go too loud, but while most phones have shrill trebles, this phone gives an amazing range of bass too. Overall, its crystal clear (no tearing) and gives the full range of trebles and bass. \nIt does have heating problem sometimes, and many people concern themselves with it, but it's really is not a problem until it becomes very extremely hot. This is one other con and the second thing that remind you this is a cheap phone. \nBattery is running okay and quite good for an android phone. Although the phone does take more time to charge than other phones.  \nAlthough it most certainly won't give you the feel of a high end phone, it remains very worthy of the price in most aspects. If it's good for you, that you have to decide.  \nNote: This is a hands-on review so I haven't written anything about connectivity problems, internet usage, benchmarks, or any problems that might manifest in the long run.

May the phone looks sexy, but nothing more than that. Let's come to the point. \nDesign: Yes, It's damn sexy. I fall in love at first sight. \n[my rating=10/10]   \nDisplay: 4.5inch big screen is good with 854 x 480 Pixels. Even In sunlight display is good enough. \n[my rating=8/10]   \nSound: Call sound is fair enough and loudspeaker is also clear and good, but can be better. \n[my rating=7/10]   \nBattery: Battery drains like hell. I think it is not a 2100mah one. \n.[my rating=4/10]   \nCamera: 5Mp Camera is not that good. All that 'Pixel Muster Technology' is a marketing Gimmick. But, 'Low light Mode' helps a lot. So many new and exciting camera features are there. In Night pictures gets noisy. In daylight they are okay. Color producing is not great though. Front is VGA. Am not going to talk about it. Not worth of talking. \n [my rating=6/10]   \nZEN UI: ZEN UI is a fresh air. Some new features are there. Really friendly to use. But, It's drains the battery. [my rating=7/10]   \nStorage and RAM: 8gb Internal is great. 1 Gb RAM works great too. I don't find any lagging, even while playing high graphics games like Asphalt 8. \n[my rating=8/10]   \nOthers: i)Have a LED notification with cool Red and Green led. \nii)ZEN UI have too many new features to explore. \niii) There's a personal assistance called &quot;Whats Next&quot;. I really like this.   \nMain Problems: i)In night pictures gets Noisy(camera Bug). \nii)Overheating while browsing, playing games, YouTub(ING). \niii)Restarts sometimes. \niv)Some bugs in Music Player. \nv) Battery drains quick. \nvi) Bluetooth problem   \nNote: I find an issue with Bluetooth. This phone can not receive file via Bluetooth simultaneously. After the second file received, when third file cones, Zenfone C automatically Discards it. I visited ASUS's service center then. They changed my device's motherboard. But the problem Remains.   \nVerdict: This is not a good choice. There are so many issues with it. I would not recommend Asus Zenfone C to any one.

No 4K video recording feature available instead of having fully capable hardware, may  \n ASUS give in their update. \n4.

Hope ASUS will provide some fix for the power consumption of WiFi.   \nGood hardware, Intel processor is just not power efficient enough so phone won't last a whole day, even with moderate use. At home I used the WiFi to catch some podcasts on Youtube,this locked up the router every time I watch a video stream(still trying to figure the issue, does not have this problem on other phones on the network).  \nSome possible good points; \n1.

", "\n I was excited with the specs of Asus Zenfone 2 when I first heard about it..and then was eagerly waiting for it to be on my palm. The specs, cost and the Red color attracted me most. So here is my feedback after using both the 2GB(16GB) and 4GB(32GB) ZE551ML versions.  \nLet's start with few critical points-  \n1. RAM - For 2GB RAM version, even after uninstalling all bloatwares possible and disabling all apps through Auto-start Manager, you end up having 600-700MB RAM most of the times. Sometimes, it gets down to 300-400MB too. Restarting the phone gets it up back to 800MB though. Even in 4GB RAM, most of the times you would get mostly around 2.2-2.3GB RAM. So, gist is, ZenUI packed OS eats up considerable RAM space, which is why I had to switch from 2GB to 4GB. Just to compare, my earlier phone Sony Xperia ZR with 2GB RAM, at any moment had more than 1GB RAM free, which was really great! Overall, I haven't seen any lagging while using in the 4GB versions, though a little bit on 2GB versions, but thats pretty marginal and for few seconds only.  \n2. Battery - 3000Mh sounds pretty heavy, however it doesn't perform up to the expectations though. With wifi on and 30 mins of gaming/streaming, the batter % goes down 1% almost every minute. So, if you start with 100%, after 30 minutes of heavy usage you'll end up with battery strength at close to 70%. But, in sleep mode, it stays pretty well. Also, with Asus boost charging available with 4GB versions, it really helps to have the phone fully charged within 80-90 minutes.  \n3. Display - Just about okay, works fine with me though didn't find it as gorgeous as my Sony Xperia ZR. Somehow, I feel display isn't bad for sure but could have been a bit better, overall with Full HD view.  \n4. Camera - I am not an expert, but this one is good enough for me with lots of betterment and customization modes, probably better than my Sony Xperia ZR (surprisingly, yes!). But, there are people who might not have been satisfied with the camera, so it comes down to individual opinions, which may differ.  \n5. Design and Look - The Red one looks really awesome and attractive! The design is pretty good too, ensuring I feel comfortable holding a 5.5inch screen on my comparatively smaller hands. Perhaps, I would have liked the regular positions of the volume control and screen lock buttons at the side instead of back and top respectively.  \n6. Speakers - Just about fine with it so far though could have been a bit louder. Speakers inside is actually smaller than the outlet shows on the back. Surprisingly, Bass boosting and Surround sound is available only in earphone/headphone mode, thats a negative in my book.  \n7. Sim - Though it's a Dual Sim phone, the second Sim slot will work only in 2G mode and can't connect to Internet. So, disappointed with it.  \n8. Flipkart - In case you have bought any phone and willing to return/exchange for any reason within 30 days, I suppose you won't get it. Because, for Flipkart it has to be a techincal fault to agree to return/replace it just being overall unsatisfied isn't enough. Though the delivery service is as usual great, but the after sales service is degrading day-by-day. So, guys, think again if you want to replace in particular costly mobile phones.  \nAs far as the phone is concerned, this is absolute beauty of a phone with great specs, price, design, looks and charger with few 'just-short-of-expectations' observations. Definitely, I would recommend everyone to consider this one particularly for daily-users willing to have a high specs yet cost saving phone.

This is a hands-on review after using it for couple of hours, so I don't know about any long term disadvantages.  \nFirst of all, it has got quite good looks for a phone this cheap. The black version, which I ordered, is gorgeous and in no way does it look like a cheap phone. You have my word on this. Also, The back cover is matte and scratch resistance. \nThe screen is not Gorilla Glass and is very highly reflective. So you always see reflection while using it, which is very annoying while gaming or watching videos. (I would suggest going for matte finish screen guard). Also the LCD is a little sunken from the main touch screen.The automatic brightness control is good but for such a reflective screen you have to use the manual controls to keep the brightness a little high. Overall the screen is one of the cons and the first thing that reminds you that this is a cheap phone. \nThe ZenUI is just amazing. Best UI i've seen after Sony. I have used Zenfone 4 and 5 and ZenUI is just as awesome as before. There are some changes like the Reading Mode (gives the screen a yellow-ish tint) is missing. \nThe camera is 5 MP on 4:3 ratio pictures. For those who click photos on 16:9 ratio (almost everyone), it is actually 4 MP. The outdoor picture quality is good and seeing the price, you could hardly get any better. The indoor quality varies according to the amount of lighting, flash on/off and night mode (overall it's grainy and very average). The front camera is disappointing and barely usable. \nThe sound quality is extraordinarily good. I mean it's excellent for this price bracket. I have used much more expensive phones than this, and most of them disappointed in all ways. It might not be able to go too loud, but while most phones have shrill trebles, this phone gives an amazing range of bass too. Overall, its crystal clear (no tearing) and gives the full range of trebles and bass. \nIt does have heating problem sometimes, and many people concern themselves with it, but it's really is not a problem until it becomes very extremely hot. This is one other con and the second thing that remind you this is a cheap phone. \nBattery is running okay and quite good for an android phone. Although the phone does take more time to charge than other phones.  \nAlthough it most certainly won't give you the feel of a high end phone, it remains very worthy of the price in most aspects. If it's good for you, that you have to decide.  \nNote: This is a hands-on review so I haven't written anything about connectivity problems, internet usage, benchmarks, or any problems that might manifest in the long run.

May the phone looks sexy, but nothing more than that. Let's come to the point. \nDesign: Yes, It's damn sexy. I fall in love at first sight. \n[my rating=10/10]   \nDisplay: 4.5inch big screen is good with 854 x 480 Pixels. Even In sunlight display is good enough. \n[my rating=8/10]   \nSound: Call sound is fair enough and loudspeaker is also clear and good, but can be better. \n[my rating=7/10]   \nBattery: Battery drains like hell. I think it is not a 2100mah one. \n.[my rating=4/10]   \nCamera: 5Mp Camera is not that good. All that 'Pixel Muster Technology' is a marketing Gimmick. But, 'Low light Mode' helps a lot. So many new and exciting camera features are there. In Night pictures gets noisy. In daylight they are okay. Color producing is not great though. Front is VGA. Am not going to talk about it. Not worth of talking. \n [my rating=6/10]   \nZEN UI: ZEN UI is a fresh air. Some new features are there. Really friendly to use. But, It's drains the battery. [my rating=7/10]   \nStorage and RAM: 8gb Internal is great. 1 Gb RAM works great too. I don't find any lagging, even while playing high graphics games like Asphalt 8. \n[my rating=8/10]   \nOthers: i)Have a LED notification with cool Red and Green led. \nii)ZEN UI have too many new features to explore. \niii) There's a personal assistance called &quot;Whats Next&quot;. I really like this.   \nMain Problems: i)In night pictures gets Noisy(camera Bug). \nii)Overheating while browsing, playing games, YouTub(ING). \niii)Restarts sometimes. \niv)Some bugs in Music Player. \nv) Battery drains quick. \nvi) Bluetooth problem   \nNote: I find an issue with Bluetooth. This phone can not receive file via Bluetooth simultaneously. After the second file received, when third file cones, Zenfone C automatically Discards it. I visited ASUS's service center then. They changed my device's motherboard. But the problem Remains.   \nVerdict: This is not a good choice. There are so many issues with it. I would not recommend Asus Zenfone C to any one.

The new Galaxy S6 has 577 ppi with a 2K display but given the fact that our eyes can`t differentiate anything above 400 ppi, that`s unnecessary.   \n# DECENT CAMERA: The 16mp shooter works pretty fine at daylight. Results are outstanding with excellent details. 4K video recording is a nice addon with xtra features of high fps shooting modes.   \n# SAMSUNG SPECIAL FEATURES: Power saving mode which turns the phone gray scale works like a charm. You can use it even without enabling the ULTRA SAVING MODE and the phone performs as it is with normal functions in grayscale mode. Saves quite a lot of juice. \nAlso the S health, air view, air gestures works as expected but are a kind of gimmick to some, as normal users won't be using them much.   \n# BATTERY LIFE: Battery life is decent and I easily manage to get a days use with moderate tasking. Phone gets hot while charging but thats completely normal.   \n# MULTI-TASKING AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE: With Adonis Prime2 SoC from the house of Samsung, two Quads clocked at 1.9 and 1.3 Ghz and heterogenous processing which enables the use of all the eight cores at once, performance is satisfactory. The available RAM is less as 1.2/2.0 GB is being eaten up by the system (I am using lollipop) heavy multi tasking might lead to stuttering but day to day activities are buttery smooth on the device.   \n# SENSORS &amp; FUNCTIONALITIES: The device packing plethora of sensors comes pretty handy at times with IR blaster etc. The heart sensor though is not that accurate but its there as an addon. \nThe swipe based Fingerprint sensor, again not at all upto the mark of the Apples`s implementation in its iPhones but got a lot better with the lollipop update. One can refer to lot of youtube videos that help how to improve the accuracy of the fingerprint sensor working   \n# REMOVABLE BATTERY &amp; SD CARD EXPANSION: Nowadays with all the flagship phones doing away with these, But I personally feel better when I have a user swappable battery &amp; a microSD card slot to go with my device. Using a Class 10 card is recommended for optimum performance.   \n# SOFTWARE UPDATES: Given the age of the device, it should be eligible to receive the Android M update too and this should keep ur ph updated for another one year atleast.   \nCONS: \n* No USB 3.0 cable. The phone is equipped with USB 3.0 port but it's a shame from Samsung's part not to ship with a 3.0 cable with it.   \n* POOR RAM MANAGEMENT: Out of available 2GB around 1.3 GB is already used up by the System &amp; pre installed apps. So heavy multitasking without a lag is not guaranteed and it's a shame given it was the flagship phone of 2014 priced at a whooping Rs 51K in India.   \n* CONFUSING &amp; RESOURCE INTENSIVE TOUCHWIZ UI: Touchwiz though it's jam packed with tons of features &amp; utilities, it does comes for a price of ur precious resources. Touchwiz interface at kitkat in Galaxy S5 is confusing. Lollipop improved it though.   \nVERDICT: \nLaunched at Rs 51K at April 2014 it was certainly not worth that price at that time but now I managed to get it at 21.5K, its absolutely a steal deal and probably the best smartphone u can get within 23K budget. The chinese manufacturers r doing well but with no proper promise of after sales services. Galaxy S5, though not a perfect device, but at 23K price point, benefits do outweigh the risks.

This is a hands-on review after using it for couple of hours, so I don't know about any long term disadvantages.  \nFirst of all, it has got quite good looks for a phone this cheap. The black version, which I ordered, is gorgeous and in no way does it look like a cheap phone. You have my word on this. Also, The back cover is matte and scratch resistance. \nThe screen is not Gorilla Glass and is very highly reflective. So you always see reflection while using it, which is very annoying while gaming or watching videos. (I would suggest going for matte finish screen guard). Also the LCD is a little sunken from the main touch screen.The automatic brightness control is good but for such a reflective screen you have to use the manual controls to keep the brightness a little high. Overall the screen is one of the cons and the first thing that reminds you that this is a cheap phone. \nThe ZenUI is just amazing. Best UI i've seen after Sony. I have used Zenfone 4 and 5 and ZenUI is just as awesome as before. There are some changes like the Reading Mode (gives the screen a yellow-ish tint) is missing. \nThe camera is 5 MP on 4:3 ratio pictures. For those who click photos on 16:9 ratio (almost everyone), it is actually 4 MP. The outdoor picture quality is good and seeing the price, you could hardly get any better. The indoor quality varies according to the amount of lighting, flash on/off and night mode (overall it's grainy and very average). The front camera is disappointing and barely usable. \nThe sound quality is extraordinarily good. I mean it's excellent for this price bracket. I have used much more expensive phones than this, and most of them disappointed in all ways. It might not be able to go too loud, but while most phones have shrill trebles, this phone gives an amazing range of bass too. Overall, its crystal clear (no tearing) and gives the full range of trebles and bass. \nIt does have heating problem sometimes, and many people concern themselves with it, but it's really is not a problem until it becomes very extremely hot. This is one other con and the second thing that remind you this is a cheap phone. \nBattery is running okay and quite good for an android phone. Although the phone does take more time to charge than other phones.  \nAlthough it most certainly won't give you the feel of a high end phone, it remains very worthy of the price in most aspects. If it's good for you, that you have to decide.  \nNote: This is a hands-on review so I haven't written anything about connectivity problems, internet usage, benchmarks, or any problems that might manifest in the long run.

"], ["Abhishek Choud...", "Not a Good Choice! ", "\n I am writing this review after one month of using this. First of I want to clear that, this is not a good choice of Smartphone at all. May the phone looks sexy, but nothing more than that. Let's come to the point. \nDesign: Yes, It's damn sexy. I fall in love at first sight. \n[my rating=10/10]   \nDisplay: 4.5inch big screen is good with 854 x 480 Pixels. Even In sunlight display is good enough. \n[my rating=8/10]   \nSound: Call sound is fair enough and loudspeaker is also clear and good, but can be better. \n[my rating=7/10]   \nBattery: Battery drains like hell. I think it is not a 2100mah one. \n.[my rating=4/10]   \nCamera: 5Mp Camera is not that good. All that 'Pixel Muster Technology' is a marketing Gimmick. But, 'Low light Mode' helps a lot. So many new and exciting camera features are there. In Night pictures gets noisy. In daylight they are okay. Color producing is not great though. Front is VGA. Am not going to talk about it. Not worth of talking. \n [my rating=6/10]   \nZEN UI: ZEN UI is a fresh air. Some new features are there. Really friendly to use. But, It's drains the battery. [my rating=7/10]   \nStorage and RAM: 8gb Internal is great. 1 Gb RAM works great too. I don't find any lagging, even while playing high graphics games like Asphalt 8. \n[my rating=8/10]   \nOthers: i)Have a LED notification with cool Red and Green led. \nii)ZEN UI have too many new features to explore. \niii) There's a personal assistance called &quot;Whats Next&quot;. I really like this.   \nMain Problems: i)In night pictures gets Noisy(camera Bug). \nii)Overheating while browsing, playing games, YouTub(ING). \niii)Restarts sometimes. \niv)Some bugs in Music Player. \nv) Battery drains quick. \nvi) Bluetooth problem   \nNote: I find an issue with Bluetooth. This phone can not receive file via Bluetooth simultaneously. After the second file received, when third file cones, Zenfone C automatically Discards it. I visited ASUS's service center then. They changed my device's motherboard. But the problem Remains.   \nVerdict: This is not a good choice. There are so many issues with it. I would not recommend Asus Zenfone C to any one.

When I planned to buy it then I noticed in most of the reviews there is a touch problem. In my handset I did not find that kind of problem but touch is not very smooth or quick though. The thing I disliked most is the length of charging cable which is way too short. The charging/usb port is on the bottom side of the phone and with that short charging cable it is almost impossible to use it while charging. The most disgusting thing is the touch scroll totally stops functioning when I tried to use it while charging. It occured every time. But when I used Micromax charger in it then the scrolling function worked properly. The battery life is moderate. The good things are surfing net and other things are really easy on it. Camera is very good...specially the selfie camera. Overall I think the software in this phone should have been more updated to clear out all such small but annoying issues with this phone.

The points that I felt as positives when deciding to go for this mobile were: \n1. 5 inch screen. I am so annoyed with the huge screen size of the recent smart phones. I will be very happy to get a phone with under 5 inch screen size and having the performance as that of this mobile. But not left with many choices when we have to prefer performance over size.  \n2. Honor 6 was there in the market for around a year and let me tell you, this is one of the very few phones which maintained a 4+ rating through out (others being the very popular Moto Phones).  \n3. Premium Look of this phone.    \nNow coming to the pros and cons of this mobile after 1 week of usage: \n1. Display is excellent \n2. Phone is very light and slim and feels premium in hand \n3. Battery is excellent. I used to have wifi and 3G always turned on. I felt great seeing that remaining battery % around 30 even around 11 PM in the night after the mobile is plugged off from the charger at 8 AM.  \n4. Performance is great. 3 GB Ram and Octocore processor. What all apps I got rid of in my Moto G due to performance issues are running like cakewalk in this mobile and with 50% of capacity still left for use.  \n5. No heating issues so far. I was afraid that opting for performance might end up buying a heat bar as most of the octacore processors have reported heating issues. This mobile looks to be different. I have not felt any heating issues so far. I will keep looking for this aspect throughout my usage with this mobile.    \nCons: \n1. Now that dual sim has become the order of the day, this phone is single sim only. Comparing the other pros, this is nothing.    \nI am rating this one 5 stars based on usage for 1 week.

The points that I felt as positives when deciding to go for this mobile were: \n1. 5 inch screen. I am so annoyed with the huge screen size of the recent smart phones. I will be very happy to get a phone with under 5 inch screen size and having the performance as that of this mobile. But not left with many choices when we have to prefer performance over size.  \n2. Honor 6 was there in the market for around a year and let me tell you, this is one of the very few phones which maintained a 4+ rating through out (others being the very popular Moto Phones).  \n3. Premium Look of this phone.    \nNow coming to the pros and cons of this mobile after 1 week of usage: \n1. Display is excellent \n2. Phone is very light and slim and feels premium in hand \n3. Battery is excellent. I used to have wifi and 3G always turned on. I felt great seeing that remaining battery % around 30 even around 11 PM in the night after the mobile is plugged off from the charger at 8 AM.  \n4. Performance is great. 3 GB Ram and Octocore processor. What all apps I got rid of in my Moto G due to performance issues are running like cakewalk in this mobile and with 50% of capacity still left for use.  \n5. No heating issues so far. I was afraid that opting for performance might end up buying a heat bar as most of the octacore processors have reported heating issues. This mobile looks to be different. I have not felt any heating issues so far. I will keep looking for this aspect throughout my usage with this mobile.    \nCons: \n1. Now that dual sim has become the order of the day, this phone is single sim only. Comparing the other pros, this is nothing.    \nI am rating this one 5 stars based on usage for 1 week.

Worth for the Money ", "\n First, Flipkart delivered it quickly and had a very good packaging.    \nNow about the Nokia 130 \nPros: \n1. Build : Solid and durable build. I had dropped it multiple times,other than few scratches it is working fine. Once it mic stopped working after a drop, but got fixed on it own after a restart. \n2. Battery : For a regular normal usage of 30-45 mins call per day, and 20 mins of music on and only one sim , the battery comes to approx 1 week. which i feel is decent. \n3. Ports : Micro-usb charging port and 3.5 mm headphone jack makes this product more usable. \n4. SD-card : I have 8gb Micro-usb card for storing my mp3 songs. The performance of reading seems to be good. \n5. Torch : Even though it is not that bright, but helps a lot during power cuts. \n6. FM and Music Player : For a mobile of this low costs finding these options make is more wantable. FM Player has storable . Even though mp3 playback quality it not great, it is good enough , better than i expected from a dumb phone.   \nCons: \n1.Call Sound: I found the sound of speaker on the other side to be little low . Have to press the piece to my ear to hear them clearly. Better use a earset to take the call. \n2.Reception : At times the signal reception is poor and drops the calls when the signal is weak. \n3.Music Player : Doesn't play protected mp3 files. In the shuffle mode, the player doesn't remember the prev track. There is no rewind or fast forward or stop . There is just pause/play. Pause acts as stop here. From the lock screen music could be changed only when you wake it up from sleep. When in sleep it the D-pad controls only the volume. Could have been more comfortable if D-pad mapping inside the player had been preserved in the sleep mode too. \n4.Contacts : We can't store more than one number for a contact. Maybe that is expected. The number of char in the name of contact is very limited ( i guess it is something like 15 , not very sure ).  \n5.Notification : Notifications of SMS or Missed Call on the lockscreen doesn't work most of the time. I had to unlock the screen everytime to find out if there has been any such event that i missed . \n6.FM : The signal reception is very mediocre. I had to balance the wire of my headset to get a clear reception. Otherwise this is decent. \n7. Sim : The size of sim is bother. It is normal sim , not a micro/nano sim. You had to get a adapter if you need to use this a substitute for your smartphone. \n8. Dual Sim: This is DSS. One sim becomes inactive ( switched off ) when you take a call in the other .   \nIf you can live with all the above cons like me , then this phone is worth the money.

", "\n I ordered this phone on reading it's features on Flipkart but upon receiving in hand, I actually got to know that it's not even that great! I would like to clear some possible misconceptions:  \n1) Bluetooth: The BT in this phone only supports file transfers (Audio and Video - Other files might be supported, however I didn't try yet) and not audio headsets.  \n2) Music: Yes, it has an in built MP3 player which plays the MP3s well and has a My Favourite playlist support. It also has a radio with 30 savable radio stations.  \n3) Video: Although it has an in-built Video player, still, it only detects MP4, AVI and plays only AVI (I only tried MP4, MKV &amp; AVI till now). \n4) Speakers: Yeah! One of the things that I liked of this phone is that its speakers are good. It's better than Samsung Galaxy Note 1. Ear - piece volume is also good.  \n5) Nokia OS: Yeah! Another thing of this phone that I liked. The new Nokia OS in this phone. It has lock screen controls i.e. We can change the song or volume even when the screen is locked or even respond to messages and missed calls keeping the screen locked.  \n6) Pre-loaded games: Only Snake Xenzia is the game pre-loaded in this phone.  \n7) Features: Yes! As usual, a very costly phone. It supports Dual SIM (Both are Normal SIM slots) but lack settings related to them. We can't set default SIMs or close one SIM or even flight mode is not supported. In call, only loudspeaker is supported i.e. no conference calling, etc.  \n8) Customization: Well, we can change the wallpapers - We can choose only from one of the three very dull-looking wallpapers. We can't choose any photo from SD card.  \n9) Quality &amp; Design: Yes, it's design is good and quality is also good.  \n10) USB: I would directly say that the USB port of this phone should be used only for charging the phone and not for file transfers. Although, it supports file transfers, but, the speed of copying files onto the SD card is much slower. I have a Class 4 SD card with a writing speed of 4-6 MB/s but I am able to copy files (Movies &amp; Songs) in this phone at 400-600 KB/s. \nFinal verdict: Guys, this phone is just like the older Nokia phones only with a Dual SIM and SD card support and with some minor OS changes. Instead go for other companies like Micromax, etc. which would give you much better features like camera, etc. in low cost.

Lost 2 of my most favorite games (8 Ball Pool and tennis world champion).    \n5. the way the speaker is placed on the phone is ridiculous... the sound is always  \nmuffled and inaudible. Also, the volume output of any audio is on the very lower side.    \n6. the pull down menu has very less options and very depressing.  \nI am an Samsung GS4 and an iPhone 6+ user.

Many a times, you will not be able to hear the voice of the other person or he might not be able to hear you.

However, it is pre-loaded with other third party apps which you would not want at all. Worst thing is, you cannot even uninstall them adding to your storage vows.    \nLastly, when I tried expanding the memory with my 8GB external memory card, the apps stopped responding and hung invariably.    \nAll in all, if you want a little bit of genuine advice for a phone, please, stay away from this product and look for another decent configuration mobile phone.

The display is highly vibrant on the 5.5 inch screen and video recording is also top notch.   \nThe performance is also noteworthy as the phone functions at a rapid speed despite a 1 GB RAM(mainly due to the Octa-core processor). There are also a number of useful apps that come pre-loaded which you may not find on many other phones.   \nThe speaker sound is decent, however, the sound quality reaches a different level altogether when you plug in the headphones(in the box).

Nexus 6 is a huge phone and to power this beast we have an approximately 3000mAH battery that drains pretty fast during the day. Phone gets heated up if you use camera for more than 15-20 mins. Didn't notice any heating issues with normal WiFi/3G browsing. Compared to other phones in the same price range (Sony Xperia Z3, HTC or iPhone), Nexus 6 still has a decent rating on the battery performance side also. AMOLED display is amazing and quite sensitive. Nexus 6 houses stereo speakers and in performance beats the iPhone 6 on audio boost. Although the pixel density is bit higher, this is no match to any iPhone. You immediately get Android upgrades from Google, so dont have to wait for a very long time. Nexus 6 has a 3GB RAM which is amazing in terms of amount of multitasking you can do and the number of background sessions you can keep open. Normal usage of the RAM is less than 1GB. In extreme cases when I opened many tabs in Chrome, 3 shopping Apps simultaneously and playing movie on Youtube, I noticed a significant usage in RAM up all the way to 2.5GB or so, still this is the best in this price range.

Went to Motorola service center earlier and was told the screen would cost me 20k and if there's any problem with the motherboard I better purchase a new one. I now have an iPhone 6. However, after searching a lot for purchasing a phone for my wife in the range of 30k, I felt I should get this repaired if it's only the issue of screen again.

"], ["ashok kr", "Not best but very Good! ", "\n It was not a easy decision to move from android to windows. Since i had one xolo android phone in home i was fond of xolo's performance. So opted for this xolo win Q1000. \nMobile:  \nOutlooks: outstanding. I opted black and white combination. Very light to hold and to carry in pocket. we can give 5/5 for looks of this phone at this price. Ofcourse its completely plastic and that will remind us that this is cheap phone! \nScreen: Color reproduction is nice. Drawback is no auto brightness. Low - medium - high are the three level adjustment for brightness. Visibility under sunlight is possible only if brightness is set to high, and in indoors low is quite enough. Viewing angles are not very great. overall 3.5/5 for screen clarity. \nBattery: with 2200 mAh battery i expected it to last less than a day with moderate performance comparing it to my previous experience with android phones. But surprisingly this lasts for much longer time. checked it with wifi and 3G on all the times. It lasted for more than one and half day. With both off it lasts for more than 2 days! Since i am not much into gaming i can't comment on battery performance for that. 5/5 for battery performance. \nCamera: This is where xolo win Q1000 is very bad. year old xolo android version (800) camera was much better than this. Eventhough it boasts of having 8 megapixel primary cam its of not much use. color reproduction, contrast and everything is bad. Not for those who use Mobile phones as primary camera. Since i use dslr thats not a big issue for me. When 8 mp cam is bad i think there is nothing to comment on 2 mp front camera! . There is no basic options in inbuilt camera application. even the video performance is quite bad. 2/5 for camera performance. \nPerformance: Android might be very famous but i feel windows is best in user friendliness. Its quite fast with just 1 gb ram. I understood that ram rom and all technical specifications are secondary to operating system! No glitches, no hang ups, smooth performance. Touch sensitivity is good enough for this range. Apps are less in windows store but you have almost everything that you need! Except few apps most of apps can be directly saved into SD card. Facebook, twitter, IE browser opens fast but i felt whatsapp loads at a slower rate. At first i was annoyed that there is no youtube app! But realised that IE loads youtube and videos at much faster rate! And if you have a slower connection better download UC browser and switch on the speed mode. Even with 2 G pages download really fast. \nPhoto gallery is nice. You can view all photos or albums or date wise. \nVideo player is average. CC player is free and better.  \nInbuilt map works offline if you download the maps. Statewise and region wise maps are available. GPS lock is superfast when compared to xolo or even other android phones. Offline navigation is best. Drawback is it doesn't have voice navigation. So downloaded HERE maps from windows store which works offline, quicker gps lock even in remote places and it gives voice commands even in offline mode. It shows the road, it shows the speed limit of the road and our vehicle speed!  \nCortana works fine but really how many times will we use those voice commands!?! \n4.5/5 for performance. \nWhoever wants to try out windows and not much worried about camera clarity can buy this.

The only good thing about that mobile was HTC's Sense interface which made the device usable as well as pleasing on the eye, it had resistive screen and the interface of WIndows Mobile 6.5 was horrible. I stayed away from Microsoft's mobile platforms ever since but then I saw this device in Flipkart, checked the video review in YouTube and couldn't refrain myself from buying this.    \nAbout Device:- \n- Device really looks good and can easily pass-off at least as a mid range handset. \n- Good build quality. \n- Display is gorgeous, touch response is smooth. \n- Speaker is loud. \n- Dual Sim is a good feature especially because Sim1 is for micro sim and Sim2 is for the old one, since my sim card was old I could use the Sim2, if it came with only micro sim then it would have been a problem. \n- No heating issue while continuous general use. \n- Battery backup is good and will easily last a day or two with moderate usage. \n- Call quality is good.    \nAbout Windows Phone:- \n- The interface is just clean and beautiful. I thought it would be confusing to use WP but the interface is consistent across different WP Apps and Settings and is very easy and straight forward to use. Windows Phone UI and this handset's design just feels like they were made for each other. \n- Gmail works in WP, real time syncing works but only problem is when composing emails I have to manually enter a person's full email address which is just not practical so for composing emails I have to use Gmail in browser which is very inconvenient. I am not sure if there is a workaround for this. There are third party apps for gmail but I found the quality of these apps questionable, one look at the screenshot and it felt like the developers aren't even trying to make a decent app. \n (For showing gmail contacts, I had to manually import Gmail contacts via Browser:- \n 1) - Got to Gmail &gt; Contacts &gt; Export &gt; Export Contacts In Google CSV Format. \n 2) - Open Outlook/Hotmail Email &gt; Click on left top side Four Tiles icon &gt;People &gt;  \n Start Import &gt; Import from Google......)  \n- WP App store is pathetic, the only app I wanted was Opera browser and only Opera Mini is available which is good only for feature phones. \n- Bing search engine is good, the results provided are relevant and are displayed in a beautiful format.  \n- Phone doesn't have smart dialing.  \nOverall, I am seriously impressed with the phone's design, build quality, low price and WP's clean interface and smooth performance. The only downside for me is the lack of quality apps.    \nUpdates:- \n- For the last couple of weeks I have noticed an issue with screen rotation, sometimes it doesn't work anywhere, in the settings it's enabled. Only way to enable it is by restarting the phone and then it works for couple of days and then stops working again.

", "\n I was over-worried as to whether it would be worth the change from nexus 5. I have to say, I couldn't have made a better choice.   \nThe main reason I chose nexus 6 is because of the absence of bloatware on it. That and the UI. I was about to go for Samsung and then realised it is filled with bloatware which causes a lot of problems (for me). I've seen a lot of people talking about how big the phone is. Yes, at first I felt the same. But to be honest, I have big hands. So, I felt comfortable holding and operating with just my thumbs after a few days. I look back at the nexus 5 and now I say to myself how tiny it was!   \nThe 3GB RAM that comes with this is heaven. No lag at all. Heavy duty games run smooth, and after updating to Android 5.1.1, all crash issues disappeared. I opted for the one with 64GB storage, so you definitely wouldn't require another sd-card storage for that. I like how, instead of the LED notification, this phone breathes (screen brigthens then dims).   \nOnly issue I face is when the speaker reduces the volume by itself and comes back when changing from potrait to landscape or vice versa. I hope this is not the fault of the device because I've seen a lot of people complaining about it online. It doesn't matter since I rarely use the speaker. The ear-piece is great and so is the microphone.   \nA great addition to this phone would be the moto 360 (smartwatch) and the motorola deck (wireless bluetooth speakers). This phone might be expensive, but it's definitely worth the buy! "], ["Rahul Pisal", "Worst Product. You will regret buying it !! ", "\n Worst product till date by Motorola and Google. Crashed so many times, I stopped keeping count after a while. Randomly would shutdown. Upgrading to 5.1.1 made the basic functions like phone, contacts stop working. Every time I would make a call, it will go dark (no option than to reboot which takes another eternity to bring the phone back up). Even with that, first reboot would not work and then would keep spinning for restarting all the apps which would take another 5-10 minutes. Overall a real shitty product by Google and Motorola and surprisingly they are selling this as premium/ cutting edge/loaded with all latest hardware type of product. \nI had to take heavy losses in selling it and had to return to familiar Samsung land.Purchasing online poses another challenge in selling it in local markets. \nI generally don't review and bash any technology like this but this time I really felt cheated...Actually don't want to give even one star... \nPlease beware !!

I'm gonna share all the experience and the adv and disadv of this phone. \nDesign- The phone is very slim and unimaginably lighweight . Its edge looks very good which has metal edging. \nPerformance:- The phone is quite smooth an doesnt lag, multitasking is decent. Overall its gd. \nScreen- The display is quite vivid as it is supposed to be cuz its a Super Amoled... so in minimum brightness too its quite clear. Outdoor mode is excellent as it provides clear view under the sun. It plays full hd videos without any issues. \nGaming:- This is the area where it beats all. Its capable of playing high end games without lag like asphalt 8, BIA 3, Modern Combat 5 etc. The biggest adv is that it doesnt heat even in extended gaming. So a thumbs up for gaming \nCamera- Camera is good bt it has some problems which I'll mention in the cons. The flash is quite amazing. It has good front and rear camera which produces clear pics bt there are issues of colour production. \nBattery- Battery is decent .. it looses 1% in 4 mins in wifi usage and on mobile data about a % in 2-3 mins. Charging is quite fast .. it charges 1% in 1min which is quite impressive   \nCons- \n1- It usually doesnt heat up bt under the sun it heats up a lot faster. Like in summer it heats upto 44\u00c2\u00b0 c in just 5 mins under sun. So u cant use it there. \n2- Camera- The camera struggles to focus on objects .. it takes time bt when it does it takes a clear photo.. bt it cannot focus on small objects. Another issue is the colour.. it captures a bit different colour than the actual one bt it is not that bad. \n3- It has no auto brightness option. \n4- THIS IS THE MOAT IMPORTANT ONE - AFTER THREE DAYS OF MY USAGE AN UPDATE CAME OF 25 MB WHICH I UPDATED OFFCOURSE bt after that it started have problems.. Like battery started to go down faster and there were lags in even normal usage.. bt that lag was gone with time SO I SUGGEST U NOT TO UPDATE UR PHONE IF IT IS OF 25MB.

", "\n I was over-worried as to whether it would be worth the change from nexus 5. I have to say, I couldn't have made a better choice.   \nThe main reason I chose nexus 6 is because of the absence of bloatware on it. That and the UI. I was about to go for Samsung and then realised it is filled with bloatware which causes a lot of problems (for me). I've seen a lot of people talking about how big the phone is. Yes, at first I felt the same. But to be honest, I have big hands. So, I felt comfortable holding and operating with just my thumbs after a few days. I look back at the nexus 5 and now I say to myself how tiny it was!   \nThe 3GB RAM that comes with this is heaven. No lag at all. Heavy duty games run smooth, and after updating to Android 5.1.1, all crash issues disappeared. I opted for the one with 64GB storage, so you definitely wouldn't require another sd-card storage for that. I like how, instead of the LED notification, this phone breathes (screen brigthens then dims).   \nOnly issue I face is when the speaker reduces the volume by itself and comes back when changing from potrait to landscape or vice versa. I hope this is not the fault of the device because I've seen a lot of people complaining about it online. It doesn't matter since I rarely use the speaker. The ear-piece is great and so is the microphone.   \nA great addition to this phone would be the moto 360 (smartwatch) and the motorola deck (wireless bluetooth speakers). This phone might be expensive, but it's definitely worth the buy! "], ["Rahul Pisal", "Worst Product. You will regret buying it !! ", "\n Worst product till date by Motorola and Google. Crashed so many times, I stopped keeping count after a while. Randomly would shutdown. Upgrading to 5.1.1 made the basic functions like phone, contacts stop working. Every time I would make a call, it will go dark (no option than to reboot which takes another eternity to bring the phone back up). Even with that, first reboot would not work and then would keep spinning for restarting all the apps which would take another 5-10 minutes. Overall a real shitty product by Google and Motorola and surprisingly they are selling this as premium/ cutting edge/loaded with all latest hardware type of product. \nI had to take heavy losses in selling it and had to return to familiar Samsung land.Purchasing online poses another challenge in selling it in local markets. \nI generally don't review and bash any technology like this but this time I really felt cheated...Actually don't want to give even one star... \nPlease beware !!

I'm gonna share all the experience and the adv and disadv of this phone. \nDesign- The phone is very slim and unimaginably lighweight . Its edge looks very good which has metal edging. \nPerformance:- The phone is quite smooth an doesnt lag, multitasking is decent. Overall its gd. \nScreen- The display is quite vivid as it is supposed to be cuz its a Super Amoled... so in minimum brightness too its quite clear. Outdoor mode is excellent as it provides clear view under the sun. It plays full hd videos without any issues. \nGaming:- This is the area where it beats all. Its capable of playing high end games without lag like asphalt 8, BIA 3, Modern Combat 5 etc. The biggest adv is that it doesnt heat even in extended gaming. So a thumbs up for gaming \nCamera- Camera is good bt it has some problems which I'll mention in the cons. The flash is quite amazing. It has good front and rear camera which produces clear pics bt there are issues of colour production. \nBattery- Battery is decent .. it looses 1% in 4 mins in wifi usage and on mobile data about a % in 2-3 mins. Charging is quite fast .. it charges 1% in 1min which is quite impressive   \nCons- \n1- It usually doesnt heat up bt under the sun it heats up a lot faster. Like in summer it heats upto 44\u00c2\u00b0 c in just 5 mins under sun. So u cant use it there. \n2- Camera- The camera struggles to focus on objects .. it takes time bt when it does it takes a clear photo.. bt it cannot focus on small objects. Another issue is the colour.. it captures a bit different colour than the actual one bt it is not that bad. \n3- It has no auto brightness option. \n4- THIS IS THE MOAT IMPORTANT ONE - AFTER THREE DAYS OF MY USAGE AN UPDATE CAME OF 25 MB WHICH I UPDATED OFFCOURSE bt after that it started have problems.. Like battery started to go down faster and there were lags in even normal usage.. bt that lag was gone with time SO I SUGGEST U NOT TO UPDATE UR PHONE IF IT IS OF 25MB.

Expecting the refund to get reflected in my account statement soon. Thanks to Flipkart for their support.   \nOriginal review:   \nIts time to submit honest reviews after using it for 3 weeks now.    \nLook -    \nSexy and stylish, quite slim and feels good in hand. Back cover which comes in the box, offers a good grip and protection for back side of the phone.    \nDisplay -    \n294 ppi display seems more than sufficient for me. The colors appear pretty vibrant, bright and the touch is impressively responsive. The phone has a good feature that allows to change the wallpaper by swiping from the top right corner to the left.    \nBattery -    \nUsually takes 1 hour 30 mins to get fully charged and lasts for around 35 hours after heavy usage that includes 3G connectivity all day long, gaming for around 30 mins a day, social networking and web browsing at frequent intervals.    \nI was expecting a little more from the battery considering its capacity of 4000 mAH (same as lenovo P780, my previous phone)    \nSound -    \nThis is a single speaker phone for music playback. Sound quality could have been better but it is fortunately acceptable and not bad at all.    \nI am not facing any issues regarding the call clarity and 3G connectivity as I read in some of online reviews about this phone. This phone executes crystal clear voice calls.    \nCamera -    \nThe camera of this phone has been highly criticized in many of the online reviews. I did not find any severe faults with the camera. Although I think 13 MP rear camera should click better pictures than what it currently delivers but the camera is not that poor at all. It anyways doesn't matter much for someone who is not a camera geek (like me)    \nPerformance -    \nP70's strongest area is its performance. 2gb RAM, 16gb internal memory and octa core processor altogether deliver a great performance in real sense. Heavy graphics games like Asphalt 8 and Spider man (pre-installed) can be played smoothly without any lags. Processing is really fast and gives good experience to the user    \nPower off Alarm - this is a surprise feature I came across after using the phone. If this feature is activated, it plays on the Alarm even when the phone is turned off.    \nI believe that speaker sound and camera could have been little better but overall I am quite satisfied and happy with my choice.    \n4 stars from my side and I recommend this phone without any hesitation.    \nHope you found this review helpful.

Its a unique brand.Performance of the cellphone can't be reached by other mobiles as it contains 1 gb ram. Moreover retina display which gives crystal clear displays.Once phone is purchased surely the life of mobile is more than 7 years. Apple forward thinking concept can be seen in phone , If you dont have an iphone, you dont have iphone. Seriously phone is far better than any other phone "], ["Vivek", "Finally - made the switch to iOS and quite comfortable with it ", "\n First things first - the delivery was prompt and it was from AAA deals (had opted for in-a-day delivery). The phone is very sleek and thin - might need a case if you have slippery hands. The build quality is excellent. Below review is from my own experience of switching from Galaxy S3 to this iphone 6+.    \nThe cons:  \n1. The phone is big - if you have small hands/prefer smaller phones in general, this is not for you (especially existing iphone users - consider iphone 6 maybe). Existing Galaxy/Note series/Nexus 6 fans however might find it easy enough to get used to but..  \n2. iOS \nBeing an Android user myself till now, I think the features offered by iOS are nowhere a match for Android.. Power users will have to get used iOS a little. And most features that are in built into Android/Cyanogen are offered by paid apps in case of iOS.  \n3. Data \nAlthough this is related to point 2 (iOS) rather than the phone itself, found it that big a deal to mention it separately.. iOS gobbles up data like mad, incremental upgrades aren't as efficient as Android (OS updates) and even regular apps are way heavier.. For e.g. consider this, Google sheets, that's 30-40 MB on android, is more than 110 MB in iOS. Considering android has to support more resolutions and phone models than iphone, I think this is gross inefficiency..  \nThe pros: \nThe advantages now: \n1. Battery: \nThe phone lasts 1.5-2 days easily with both location and background app refresh (sync) on all the time. My phone still has 9% despite 8 hours of usage and 32 hours of standby (after plugged out of full charge yesterday morning). That's a good 40 hours of usage. On the other hand, I'm yet to hear about an android phone that lasts more than a day with Sync, Google now and location set to on - even the nexus 6 would barely last a few hours more than a day.. This is not an understatement - this is easily the best phone in terms of battery life today (To be fair, worthy competitors in android are Note 4, Oneplus One, Nexus 6 &amp; Moto Turbo - all of them come close but not quite matching up to this)  \n2. Camera: \nThe camera is still 8 MP, but has digital and optical image stabilization. Shoots fast and quite good - functions so smoothly. Low light photography works great. The only better phone cameras out there (in Android) are Galaxy s6 and LG G4. And considering this is just 8 MP but still matches up with the best cameras out there, the file size difference is quite an advantage..  \n3. iOS: \nAlthough it has its pains, iOS still has its advantages - the entire OS feels very smooth and lag free (can't stress this enough - even the best of the Android phones starts lagging after six months or so). Even other minor features - the passbook, Stocks, Apple health all of them have equivalent Android apps, but the tight integration with the core OS is much better here. Also - iTunes sync - a lot of people might hate it, but this is still the best software to sync playlists and songs. To give you an example, you can even set a track to play only between the start of minute 2 and 3 on your desktop, and the same will get synced on to your iphone/ipod (tried removing preludes in a song anyone?)  \nSo yes, this phone has its advantages and disadvantages - but at the end of the day if you just want a smartphone to last long, shoot great photos and are ready to experiment with iOS a little, I think this is for you. Considering the best android phones are almost the same price (S6/S6 edge) and given that they run Touchwiz, this decision was a no-brainer after all :) "], ["Kunal Saini", "Iphone 6 plus ", "\n excellent phone as you all know apple make always best phone in mobile industry..   \nExcellent camra, bettery backup, display quality, overall excellent phone "], ["Abhishek verma", "good product &amp; exactly same as described ", "\n good product &amp; exactly same as described. \ngood packing with very very fast delivery.   \ngood product &amp; exactly same as described. \ngood packing with very very fast delivery.

After using Nokia. BlackBerry. iPhone. Sony Experia. Samsung and Motorola. I came to discover dis Xolo Q1200 a venture of lava. I bought from Flipkart with a decent delivery. I bought it for its nice look and of course Gorilla glass-3 to be frank. Wanted to give a try on China mobile. This is my only biggest mistake. Becoz, it took me only a day to hate this mobile.    \nMy honest verdict :- \nBATTERY: one of the poorest. even without 2G usage, the battery discharges one by one point as soon as you ON the mobile. Reason behind it is that the stupidity done by the engineer/developer to give it a high resolution of 1080p without making the battery compatible to it. Hence fooling Indians. This not happens in case of branded mobiles.  \nCAMERA : Average. night mode also average. but when you take video it is showing 1080p 3gpp quality not a MP4 dis may be a drawback for some.  \nSOUND : it is mentioned in the box as DTS but nothing like that when you listen to bass oriented club edit DJ songs you will be frustrated with quality of sound it reaches your ear like some 3rd rated crap sound. Huff Pathetic! Sound quality good ONLY for Ghazal and romantic/silent songs only. \nGAMING / 3G USE: When use 3G or play Hi-end games it plays all but the mobile Gets Heated like burning sensation sort at the back panel. \nPROCESSOR / OS : Good clock speed no issue. and operating system is jelly bean upgradable to kit kat so no issue. My Bottom line is Xolo Q1200 is good in many aspects but poor in battery level. There is nothing to blame Flipkart for this. I am buying products from Flipkart since 3 years.... but first time I bought a China set like Xolo. Believe it or not it took 23% of battery discharge in typing this review in a XOLO notepad.

Period. I don't need to say more, its very beautiful.   \n- BUILD QUALITY : The premium and supreme feeling you get when you pick this is tough to explain. The phone is very light weight, no creaking noises, everything is intact and the buttons are super clicky and high quality.   \n- BATTERY LIFE : Again, this phone has the BEST battery life under the 20-25K price point. You can easily get upto 2 days of battery life with moderate usage everyday. Heavy users can make it through the day easily too.   \n- CAMERA : Again, never go on specs, this phone's camera is exceptional. Better than Oneplus One and the phone gives sharp and non-grainy pictures even at night. Both cameras are excellent.   \nThings that are not so great with this device :   \n- PRICE : Definitely a bit overpriced. It should be priced around 17K.   \n- GAMING &amp; PERFORMANCE : Don't get me wrong, this device can handle the games like Asphalt 8 very easily at medium graphics setting but don't expect playing games on high graphics setting at it. For everyday usage this device is lag free and super snappy, multitasking isn't an issue at all.   \nAlso some features which should have been in here are missing for no apparent reason, wtf Samsung?   \n- NO LIGHT SENSOR : Hence there's no auto brightness mode \n- NO USB OTG SUPPORT : You can't connect pen drives etc to this device \n- NO SCREEN PROTECTION : There's no gorilla glass protection which is available in low end devices as well \n- NO LED NOTIFICATION LIGHT : Not much big of a deal, honestly. \n- In ultra power saving mode, the screen doesn't get gray-scaled like in other Samsung devices. Just, why? \n- Haptic feedback isn't there. You know the mini vibration when you tough the screen / type? Yeah, its not there.   \nIf the upper given things don't mind you, then go for it as its AMAZING in all other aspects.

In day light it fails to capture the background, in dull light it gives even duller pics, even in your room if you are having a lights switched on, the selfies you take will not come out clear aswell.   \nYes, the android version is good, it has a decent internal memory, doesnt lag, battery life is good, but taking good quality photographs especially outdoors wont fetch you the desired happiness.    \nI went to the service center of samsung, and the staff were rigid and rude to even listen and see the picture quality issues. I took pictures from that cracked htc and compared with this &quot;new&quot; phone and the counter they had was we dont see any fault in the pictures ( as if theyre blind ).   \nBought is for Rs18,500. sold it off for Rs14,000 within 3 days.    \nI have purchased HTC Desire 820G DS instead and I must say I regret wasting money on Samsung.   \nSamsung, clearly You guys have compromised on the camera. I am so sorry to say, the 8 mega pixels and 5 mega pixels you offer in this phone, is not upto the standard.   \nSTOP BEING SUB-STANDARD. \nNever buying or recommending Samsung to anybody.

The mobile takes upto 4 hours for charging but drains out the battery in 1 hour in standby mode , worst phone i have ever seen , never buy ,t wo time i replaced the set with the new one but the problem remains the same. In the last thanks to Flipkart they refunded my amount too quick . Got job :) "], ["Pranata Naskar", "Satisfied After Buying X1 ", "\n My old phone was broke so i needed a new one.After reading reviews and specifications on flipkart for almost 5 days about diff phones I decided to buy this phone.I choose this phone over Redme2,Lenovo A600 plus and honor Holy. \nNow about the phone-after using it for 2weeks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. \nSimply specification wise\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.   \n1. THE FLIP COVER-This is the only phone that providing that kind of smart feature in this range.You can watch a you tube video for more details.   \n2. CAMERA (4/5)- \n Rear-8MP is really good,but not enough if you compare it with others (Nokia,Sony).It has 196ppi pixel density. But one thing that really good is its BSI II sensor, which allow you to shoot crystal clear pic in low light. I have taken pic just with a 7watt night lamp without flash, but amazingly pic was too clear as if shoot in daylight. \n Font-2MP font is enough for me as I am not that much selfy-shooter.But one thing is for sure with its unique \u00e2\u0080\u009cFace Beauty\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u0098Smile Detection\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look bad.   \n3. DISPLAY (5/5)-5\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 display is enough for better viewing experience. On full contrast there is no problem of viewing it in day light.You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to cover the screen with your hand to view the content in day light. I only use 50% of full contrast in day light. Enough for me.   \n4. PROCESSOR(5/5)-With 1.3GHz of processor there is no lag.At least I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t experienced it yet. Have run 15 app in back ground(Chrom,opera,5pdf file,you tube,subway,rail rush,and others).   \n5. RAM-Out of 1gb you will get 625MB on first boot.   \n6. ROM-you will get 5.8GB of user memory fully dedicated for your app\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and personal files if you din\u00e2\u0080\u0099t install sd card.Used as common storage space for app and user file if sd not present.   \n7. OS-when it comes to OS in you-tube review the phone has 4.4kitkat but my phone has android Lollypop 5.0 previously installed. So no need to upgrade it.But there is a 17Mb of update available. After updating phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s RAM utilization increased.   \n8. MUSIC-Ring tones are loud enough while you are travelling, but not enough if you are in local train. \nI am not a music critic so can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you precisely, but ear plug is really loud and has a clear bass.   \n9.CONNECTIVITY-Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to write about wifi and blueTooth,bt one extra feature that I found is that it support BlueTooth Tethering beside USB Tethering. Which is unique.   \nLastly (CON) \n10. BATTERY-It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battery is its con,with heavy uses it only lasts 4 hours(game,browsing,only one movie in full 1080p can be watched).Lava should have provided a 3000mAm battery.    \nIf you like my review don't forget to like it.

Starting from out of the box, experience isn't great at all. My father was totally confused on how to use this phone. It's not that he is using mobile phone for the first time, so something should be problematic with the user interface, design etc here. I did read few reviews in flipkart for this product who showed their frustration on this product, which unfortunately I ignored over other good comments and overall 4 star rating for the same (come on buyers, 4 star of this ???).   \nI admit yet to see this phone myself as it got delivered to my father's place directly. But for me if he isn't satisfied and willing to use old mobile phone he has instead, then it indicates this product is a failure. Few issues to list (which my father told me he faced):   \n1) SMS forward isn't working (it may be a product defect on this piece, but we yet to take it the service center to get it fixed); however fresh SMS worked. Surprisingly, vendor did deducted SMS charges even though it failed to forward to the recipient.   \n2) Phone ring suddenly goes to silent ... not sure if my father pressed any key continuously to enable it, but come on, he never faced this kind of issues with old phone he has. I'm always ended up calling on his landline now as he is unable to hear the ring on this mobile.   \n3) It took neighbor's to disable speaking out called-id number before it starts ringing the phone. Do we call it senior citizen friendly phone if they cannot do it by itself ?!   \nOnce I visit my father, I will have more closer look at this to figure out other cons of this phone. My only suggestion for now is, be careful before buying this (at least make sure you try out at some shop before purchasing online, to understand the comfort using it). I can certainly find much better phones like Nokia at much cheaper rate than this with excellent quality/user-interface ... I think I'll end up buying one of that now throwing this piece.

Found this in one of the reviews for Note 4. \n&quot;1. The upcoming OS Android L needs 64 bit processors FOR 64 BIT apps. In future all apps will be redesigned for 64-bit processors. You will have to spend again to upgrade to 64 bit&quot; \nIf the above is true, then why would Nexus 6 come up with a 32 Bit processor. Nexus is supposed to be the Benchmark Android device and all new OS updates lands first on it. 64 Bit processor just lets you handle more data transfer on to processor at any given time. That results in a slightly improved performance. Apps don't have to be 64 bit for that unlike in computers. \nDo some research before you post an expert review and Mislead people. "], ["srikanth reddy", "Note 4 Performance ", "\n It's really superb phone only the disadvantage is it is bigger phone then compare to others and the camera is awesome . "], ["BALAJI R", "NEVER THOUGHT SAMSUNG WAS THIS AWESOME!!! ", "\n Firstly I have to appreciate Flipkart for their committed one day delivery. The phone was delivered to me the next day before lunch. Was just awesome.    \nAs it was an online purchase, i was bit skeptical about the genuineness of the product like most of the online shopping freaks out there. But found out that all seals were intact and confirmed it is original, as the phone was detected by smart switch and received OTA updates for lollipop. Genuineness is assured from WS Retail as far as my experience so far is concerned. Price was the cheapest compared to any other sites when i bought this phone. Hats off for that.    \nNow lets come to the phone part... \nI was confused between S6 and Note 4 and finally decided to go with Note 4 for some additional features like s-pen, 5.7 inch screen etc. WOW!!! is one word in which i can describe the mobile.. What a build quality and what a sexy look. Its one of the Ms.Universe contestant from Samsung's stable combined with a beastly performance.  \nPros: \n*Build quality (Metal) is beyond explainable. Its too good sturdy and beautiful at the same time. Especially the bronze gold colour compliments it's bold design.Back cover is also awesome and gives a sensual feel holding the device. \nThe 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4 is one of the best design i have seen. From any angle you look at the phone, it's beauty is self explanatory. \n*Brilliant 5.7 inches QHD display which makes anyone say WOW with their 1st look. The crispness even in a black background is irresistible. The viewing angles were awesome. Even when seen from 300 + degree, the screen is clearly visible. Cheers to 2,5D Gorilla glass and QHD display. The screen size is one big differentiator between Note 4 &amp; S6. \n*Camera clarity is very good. Especially with OIS, which gives a awesome picture clarity even in low light. Videos are also of ultimate qualty. Features like slo-mo are fun. \n*Heart rate sensor, UV sensor are really working great. \n*Adaptive fast charging is just awesome. It achieves 0 to 100% in less than 1.5 hrs which is great. \n*Battery backup lasts for a day with average usage (5 hrs wifi, 2-3 hrs calls, frequent exploring of mobile) \n*4g connectivity \n*Touchwiz is optimized and is so smooth. \n*Snapdragon 805 processor which makes this beast beastly. \n*IR blaster is so good and i'm using my Note 4 for operating my TV and set-top box. It also reminds me of my favorite programmes. \n*Last but not the least, the USP of Note 4, s-pen is at its best. The sensitivity and the pressure levels are just beyond explainable. Feels like writing in a paper itself. This is one of the major factor that made me purchase Note 4 than S6.  \nCons: \nNot much really. But few things could have been: \n*No 64bit processor. \n*Fingerprint sensor could have been better (Like one in S6). \n*Being a flagship and premium price range, Water and dust proof could have been added.  \nFinally, i never or will never regret for buying this phone and its worth every penny spent.    \nLove my Note 4 (Bronze gold Note 4 has become my dream phone) and Love You Samsung for making my 1st Samsung phone an outstanding one. "], ["Prashanth Soma...", "Good but could have been Better ", "\n Using it for more than a week now. Overall a nice experience but at times the UI is sluggish. In the benchmark it scored me way below than what it should. Got few updates as soon as I opened it from the box. The packing could have been better as I see the box was already ill treated but luckily the internals where good. Flipkart as usual did a good job in delivering it on the same day but as I said, packing good have been better. The offer price was also tag higher for a six month old device. All in all, this is a good phone to buy even the battery backup is fine. Do not listen to users who say a lot on the battery but its better than a usual average phone. I get upto 4 hours on screen time and thats a good number to have. Go for it wont be a right thing to say but you can definitely give a try. Can be a worthy successor for your liking.

"], ["Amit Majumder", "Get a life loosers ", "\n To all those &quot;Smart&quot; people who are calling the Note 4 is not future proof, read this. If 64-bit was that much important as you people say it,  \nahem &quot;The upcoming OS Android L needs 64 bit processors. In future all apps will be redesigned for 64-bit processors. So if you buy a 32 bit processor you won't get the full power of future OS and future 64-bit apps. You will have to spend again to upgrade to 64 bit&quot; ahem,    \nIf it was really that important, THE NEW NEXUS 6 WOULD HAVE ALSO GOT A 64-BIT CHIP INSTEAD OF A 32-bit one. Get a life people? Complaining that 4K screen is going to be mainstream in 2015? Yeah, in that time when people would go to buy them, you would suggest something even greater would come the next year and so-on. This shit is useless. The NOTE 4 is the best smartphone to date. it is a fact and get to accept it. "], ["Vikram Raj", "Note 4 is the best at present BUT READ THIS FULLY AND YOU DECIDE ", "\n I don't want to compare any other brands and mock them. In Today's Market Note 4 is the best in class. I will be honest in this user review and you decide what is best for you after reading this. Samsung needs to reduce the price for sure. The Price is way too much at this point to buy.   \nI used the Note 3 for almost 10 months. The Note 4 is improved in all the areas but Is it time to upgrade?? I WILL LET YOU DECIDE.  \nThe note 4 's biggest changes from Note 3    \n1. QUAD HD 2K (2560X1440) SCREEN IS GORGEOUS BUT 4K SCREENS ON MOBILE IS ON THE CORNER SO within next May 2015 we may get 4k screens on mobile with 64bit processors from Snapdragon so why upgrade?. So this quad HD thing is SUPERB but only for the new purchasers not for upgrades. Another minus is lack of USB 3.0 which was awesome in note 3.    \nSCREEN SENSITIVITY- Samsung has increased screen sensitivity 200 percent. Now the Stylus is very very responsive and the screen captures even the slightest of touches made by the stylus compared to the slight lag in Note 3.   \nADAPTIVE FAST CHARGING IS AWESOME. 0-42 percent charge reached in 30 minutes, Full charge was achieved in 1 hour 12 minutes. Where as note 3 with USB 3.0 took 2 hours and 2 minutes to reach full charge. The battery backup is amazing. it lasts a easy 14 hours with heavy usage.    \nMETAL BODY IS SUPERB - Hats off to Samsung for finally bringing a premium feel to the phone after years of plastic.   \n4G COMPATIBILTY IN INDIA IS SUPER. It works with Airtel and Indian bands 2300Mhz called TD LTE along with International 4G compatibility. The speed I got is 30 Mbps Download and 7 Mbps upload. Get a USIM and Enjoy. Since this is factory unlocked. You can use it in all International 4G bands.    \nTOUCHWIZ IS A MAJOR CHANGE touchwiz is very smooth and hatsoff to samsung for finally giving a lag free OS.    \nFor phone to have these much Software enhancements and sensors and A HUGE TOO MUCH PRICE TAG OF 57-58K. we definitely WANTED A WATERPROOF AND DUST PROOF PHONE. But Samsung has let us down big time here. Why I am saying is  \nThe heart rate sensors, The IR blaster, UV sensors need protection when we go outside. When jogging OR IN FULL SUNLIGHT OR DURING RAIN . THERE IS A HUGE POSSIBILITY OF SWEAT OR RAIN AFFECTING THE PHONE.    \nTHE MAJOR POINT FOR ALL CUSTOMERS WHO WISH TO BUY. READ THIS VERY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE \n--&gt; It's coming with Snapdragon 805 32-bit and not the 64-bit Exynos 5433 processor which International markets get. I am not saying this is not fast. This is VERY FAST but The advantage of 64 bit: \n1. The upcoming OS Android L needs 64 bit processors FOR 64 BIT apps. In future all apps will be redesigned for 64-bit processors. You will have to spend again to upgrade to 64 bit \n2.Another big difference between 32-bit processors and 64-bit processors is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that is supported. 32-bit systems can support a maximumof 3-4GB RAM, where as a 64-bit processor can support memory of over 4GB RAM. A 64-bit processor can run 32-bit apps without any issues but a 32-bit system can never run a 64-bit app. 64-bit is also important for apps that use graphical engineering design, video editing .ITS NOT A DRAW BACK. BUT YOU DECIDE IT FOR YOURSELVES WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU. \n The snapdragon 800 or 801 users cannot find a major difference from 805. its VERY FAST AND GOOD for now but not 64-bit. International markets get exynos 64-bit 5433 processor. The antutu benchmark also rates the exynos 64-bit version of note 4 much higher than snapdragon 805 32-bit.    \n OIS - OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION( best upgrade from note 3and Wide angle selfie is a major boost. SLO-MO - slow motion is very good too.    \nFINGER PRINT SENSOR- works better than Galaxy S5 but needs lot of improvements in its use and utility like its Rival.   \nMY PLAN IS TO WAIT FOR GALAXY UNTIL THE 64BIT SNAPDRAGON 810 COMES AND 4K SCREEN COMES. Right now you won't find a big difference if you use note 3. I am an extreme user. Even I FOUND the Note 3 sufficient. Note 4 is exceptional but buy it only if you have an old phones of 2010 or 12 or you want a change OR EXTRA BUCKS. else you can wait for the next galaxy.    \nI DONT REGRET ONE MOMENT PURCHASING NOTE 4 BUT You might realise note 3 is more than enough at present but its only my view. If you are lg or apple user and want a new phone with new experience. I would advise you to go for note 4 immediately just to find the awesomeness of the features Note 4 offers. But for note 3 users upgrading to note 4 especially at this HUGE price is not wise. Note 3 stylus is very sufficient   \nMY VERDICT - NOTE 4 STANDS ABOVE ALL THE RIVALS AT PRESENT. GO FOR IT WHEN THE PRICE IS BROUGHT DOWN TO 45-50K "]], "title": "Samsung Galaxy Note 4"}

Its a unique brand.Performance of the cellphone can't be reached by other mobiles as it contains 1 gb ram. Moreover retina display which gives crystal clear displays.Once phone is purchased surely the life of mobile is more than 7 years. Apple forward thinking concept can be seen in phone , If you dont have an iphone, you dont have iphone. Seriously phone is far better than any other phone "], ["Vivek", "Finally - made the switch to iOS and quite comfortable with it ", "\n First things first - the delivery was prompt and it was from AAA deals (had opted for in-a-day delivery). The phone is very sleek and thin - might need a case if you have slippery hands. The build quality is excellent. Below review is from my own experience of switching from Galaxy S3 to this iphone 6+.    \nThe cons:  \n1. The phone is big - if you have small hands/prefer smaller phones in general, this is not for you (especially existing iphone users - consider iphone 6 maybe). Existing Galaxy/Note series/Nexus 6 fans however might find it easy enough to get used to but..  \n2. iOS \nBeing an Android user myself till now, I think the features offered by iOS are nowhere a match for Android.. Power users will have to get used iOS a little. And most features that are in built into Android/Cyanogen are offered by paid apps in case of iOS.  \n3. Data \nAlthough this is related to point 2 (iOS) rather than the phone itself, found it that big a deal to mention it separately.. iOS gobbles up data like mad, incremental upgrades aren't as efficient as Android (OS updates) and even regular apps are way heavier.. For e.g. consider this, Google sheets, that's 30-40 MB on android, is more than 110 MB in iOS. Considering android has to support more resolutions and phone models than iphone, I think this is gross inefficiency..  \nThe pros: \nThe advantages now: \n1. Battery: \nThe phone lasts 1.5-2 days easily with both location and background app refresh (sync) on all the time. My phone still has 9% despite 8 hours of usage and 32 hours of standby (after plugged out of full charge yesterday morning). That's a good 40 hours of usage. On the other hand, I'm yet to hear about an android phone that lasts more than a day with Sync, Google now and location set to on - even the nexus 6 would barely last a few hours more than a day.. This is not an understatement - this is easily the best phone in terms of battery life today (To be fair, worthy competitors in android are Note 4, Oneplus One, Nexus 6 &amp; Moto Turbo - all of them come close but not quite matching up to this)  \n2. Camera: \nThe camera is still 8 MP, but has digital and optical image stabilization. Shoots fast and quite good - functions so smoothly. Low light photography works great. The only better phone cameras out there (in Android) are Galaxy s6 and LG G4. And considering this is just 8 MP but still matches up with the best cameras out there, the file size difference is quite an advantage..  \n3. iOS: \nAlthough it has its pains, iOS still has its advantages - the entire OS feels very smooth and lag free (can't stress this enough - even the best of the Android phones starts lagging after six months or so). Even other minor features - the passbook, Stocks, Apple health all of them have equivalent Android apps, but the tight integration with the core OS is much better here. Also - iTunes sync - a lot of people might hate it, but this is still the best software to sync playlists and songs. To give you an example, you can even set a track to play only between the start of minute 2 and 3 on your desktop, and the same will get synced on to your iphone/ipod (tried removing preludes in a song anyone?)  \nSo yes, this phone has its advantages and disadvantages - but at the end of the day if you just want a smartphone to last long, shoot great photos and are ready to experiment with iOS a little, I think this is for you. Considering the best android phones are almost the same price (S6/S6 edge) and given that they run Touchwiz, this decision was a no-brainer after all :) "], ["Kunal Saini", "Iphone 6 plus ", "\n excellent phone as you all know apple make always best phone in mobile industry..   \nExcellent camra, bettery backup, display quality, overall excellent phone "], ["Abhishek verma", "good product &amp; exactly same as described ", "\n good product &amp; exactly same as described. \ngood packing with very very fast delivery.   \ngood product &amp; exactly same as described. \ngood packing with very very fast delivery.

Now at sub 25K pricing makes sense and it is a steal in this price range. Please don't go by non certified buyer's reviews. Most of them are suckers because they couldn't afford this beauty at its launch. Before buying this I bought One Plus One and returned that within 3 days and swore not to go for low priced Chinese junks which claim to have great specifications but at a worst possible quality.  \nThis phone puts all those Chinese maker to shame with its great features and quality. Display is amazing and I don't think any other brand can even come closer to Samsung.  \n16 MP primary camera takes great pictures in all lighting conditions. 2 MP front camera disappoints a little bit but I am not into selfies at all so I don't care. It is great for video calling with Skype. \nI am yet to test its water proof feature and don't want to do that. This verdict is reserved for unforeseen rainy scenarios. \nFinger print is good feature but it is not as convenient as iPhones. It works only in 50-60% of the times.  \nHeart rate sensor it just for gimmick. I have used only on the day I got the phone. \nSamsung's UI is not as good as stock Android due to lot of bloatware. You can install a custom ROM but it will void the warranty. I am going to try it after warranty period is over. \nMost of the preinstalled apps are useless and can't be removed and eat you data with frequent updates. User available memory is about 11GB and around 700-800 MB RAM will be available after system essentials.   \nBattery like is acceptable. It lasts 1.5 days with moderate usage (2g networks with internet always on, 2 hours of calls, couple of hours on WiFi network for downloading apps/updates). I can't tell how much it will last on 3g networks. I don't know why people are cribbing about no LTE. There are hardly 4-5 cities have 4g and it will make a hole in your pocket with current plans. I am still on 2g network and still find 3g plans unaffordable.  \nOnly this I don't like is heating when I use phone with WiFi on. It is not burning hot like One Plus One I got but still very warm. \nIf you only care for specifications then it is not the phone for you. You will feel it is overpriced. Then you should always trust cheap Chinese ones.  \nIf you trust only established brands, crave for quality then blindly go for this. It is best phone in this price.   \nPros: \n. Best display in all the available phones \n. Great camera for low light photos \n. 4K video recording \n. Very good build quality (Dropped it for couple if time and no issues so far) \n. Battery life is good. \n. Great multitasking    \nCons: \n. UI is not good with lots of bloatware \n. Heating problem (Not recommended if you are a gamer) \n.

Overall display is a visual treat for watching hd videos. \n2.Boomsound speakers \nArguably the best front firing speakers for smartphones.The sound quality is audible and clear enough than other competitors. \n3.Xelio X10 processor \nSome may be concerned about going for a mediatek, initially i too had that in mind. When you use the device you can feel that you are wrong.It can match with equivalent snapdragon processors.There is no lags or slowdown so far. The eight cores does a good job when it come to multitasking. The gpu should have been improved but it does not reflect on performance though..I was able to play Real racing 3, FIFA 15, Dead Trigger 2 without any lags. \nIn benchmarking it gives a 49736 for antutu, 60.3fps in Nenamark2 and Geekbench3 multi core score of 4507. \nPlus on a positive note, continuous benchmark tests shows that the mediatek maintaned stable performance while Qualcomm tend to decrease in performance due to thermal effect. \n3. Camera \nA 20mp back camera covered with a sapphire glass. The camera is very fast in clicking and the detail of the picture also good. For those who know how to change aperture, iso,shutter speed there is a full manual control available.The htc M9+ can save in raw format but that camera upadate may be available soon for e9+ too. \nBokeh mode, slow motion video capture and a bunch of camera option available to play with. Another major feature is that it can shoot 4k videos which is now getting to all top end smartphones.but full hd will do fine as of now.The fhd video quality is good. \nAnother feature is the low light capable ultrapixel camera. As htc advertise it performs pretty well under low lit conditions. \n4.Software \nE9+ ships with android 5.0.2 out of the box and htc sense 7 ui. The blend of these two is very carefully done and it gives the user a smoother and personalized user interface. \n5.Design and form factor \nThe device is well built and looks premium. It feels very light in hand you might want to add a back cover or dot case(which i didn't got so far) for extra grip and protection..The phone is bit taller and one handed use may feel uncomfortable at times but i hope you will get used to it soon. \n6.Battery \nThe device packs a 2800mah non removable battery which provides enough juice to take to a full day with moderate usage.If you are a heavy user you may need to opt for power saving mode or extreme power saving mode at the end of the day.On a full charge in the morning i was able to get 25% left at night aftr using with airtel 4G all day, whatsapp, facebook, image editing, A full length 2hr movie, songs. \nSo the battery is ok as far as the specs are concerned.htc software paired with Android does a good job in keeping the phone running efficiently. \nOverall verdict: \nIts a premium looking smartphone with killer specs.

Here is my take, comparing mainly with S6 or Iphone 6:   \nCons: \n1) Camera is 20 megapixel but certainly not as great in low light or inside as it has been claimed. With all possible settings pictures are not as sharp and great.  \n2) Lots of sensors that even S4 had have not found place here. Gives you a slightly climb down feeling. \n3) In-call audio is definitely less crispy and clear. \n4) Phone calls are audible only if the left end of the phone is on your ear. \n5) Stereo speakers are good, but no equaliser or audio quality settings. I downloaded audio apps. \n6) It takes painfully long to charge. Though initial 255 are quite fast. \n7) Some basic touch sensor gestures and motions to send texts and make calls in S4 are also missing here! \n8) The screen area could have been easily increased. \n9) The battery is not replacable.   \nPros: \n1) Despite all these cons I am not unhappy with the buy. Certainly feels an upgrade over S4 on many counts. \n2) Battery life is much better than Samsung. \n3) The price is pretty good! After SBI card discount offer in the flipkart app it cost Rs 33.5k. Not bad for a nice big screen.   \nBuying here? \n1) Flipkart has a WRONG description/specs of the phone. This phone has two sim card slots, not one as claimed in the specs here. \n2) Tracking of order was very nicely updated on the app and was pretty cool! \n3) Delivery time? Flipkart was pretty good with generally 48 hrs delivery. But was given a deadline of 10 odd days. Though it landed after 6 days. \n4) It surely could have been faster.   \nIf you are clear that you want to save money and still want a pretty good deal, go for it.

First of all the outer look will beat any phone in the market, sleek, appropriately combined with colors (Gold Sepia looks the best). Display is very vibrant and everything appears real in the screen.   \nSecond comes the Camera. No doubt a 20 MP camera does all the wonders required on daily life. Even there are certain modes which are available on DSLR cameras only.   \nThird comes the battery. 2800 MAH battery is enough for full day use even if you are a hardcore mobile user. Here are my own examples- \nDay 1:- Received in the evening a 5 PM and when opened, the battery was 58 %. I switched on the phone, configured it with Wi-Fi and used continuously up to 10 PM via Wi-Fi only downloading the apps, doing personalization and transferring all the things from old phone and the battery left at 10 PM was 21 %. \nDay-2:- Fully charged previous night and the battery remaining in the morning was 89 % then I started the day again at 8 AM with the same curiosity things on a new phone and kept 3G on permanently for whole day and using Whatsapp, Facebook, net surfing and at the end of the day at 5 PM, the battery remaining was 39% which lasted for whole night and needed charging in the morning. \nDay-3:- started with 100 % battery at 7 AM and installed about 100 apps and configured all of them, watched videos, taken pictures, whatsapp was permanently on and 3G was also permanently on. Made my own themes and did various things not allowing the screen to be off even for a second i.e. used it continuously for 5 hours doing all the things and screen was kept open for 5 hours continuously without a blink of screen. Any other phone would have begged for charging and would have heated up to boiling point but this one left with 27 % battery and cool like was kept in AC. All these things were apart from the calls I received and dialed which is average 40 calls before noon and 40 after noon. \nP.S. :- If you switch off data connection, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wonder from where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operating i.e. battery is almost not at all used. \nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think anyone would require more rigorous use of phone than this. So you can be sure of battery lasting the day long irrespective of your field.  \nThe features don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be told as are already mentioned. Yes corrections are as below- \n1. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dual SIM phone not a single SIM \n2. SD card support is up to 2 TB and not only 128 GB \n3. The weight of the phone is 135 gm and not 150 gm \nAll these features are not available even on high budget phones up to 55 K so you should grab it for sure. \nCons:- \n1. The phone is large in size and its because the bezel is much more. The size can be reduced by almost an Inch if HTC would have designed it precisely. \n2. User Interface is not as much appealing as is in Samsung premium phones and LG premium phones. I was using LG G2 and I will still declare it a winner over E9+ on inner appearance of the phone. \n3. HTC is giving a charger with 1 AMP adapter which will require about 2 and half hours to charge the phone to full. They should have given at least 2 AMP so that charging time could have been reduced to half. \nOverall it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a treat on 35 K. You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get such features in this budget and that too from a renowned company like HTC. So don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think, just go for it.

Moreover I have not saved a lot of files on my memory card \nIt does not have FM and it is good that it does not have because listening to FM is waste of time unless you have the patience to listen to advertisements. \nThis phone has been designed in such a manner that there is no wastage of surface on the device, compare this phone with a few HTC devices with same screen sizes.

Why to make a devices bigger for no good reasons.   \nThere is one area where other devices with similar features surpass it that is the weight of this phone and Samsung\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obsession for plastic. It looks so damn cheap if you remove the back lid of this phone.

Worth for the Money ", "\n First, Flipkart delivered it quickly and had a very good packaging.    \nNow about the Nokia 130 \nPros: \n1. Build : Solid and durable build. I had dropped it multiple times,other than few scratches it is working fine. Once it mic stopped working after a drop, but got fixed on it own after a restart. \n2. Battery : For a regular normal usage of 30-45 mins call per day, and 20 mins of music on and only one sim , the battery comes to approx 1 week. which i feel is decent. \n3. Ports : Micro-usb charging port and 3.5 mm headphone jack makes this product more usable. \n4. SD-card : I have 8gb Micro-usb card for storing my mp3 songs. The performance of reading seems to be good. \n5. Torch : Even though it is not that bright, but helps a lot during power cuts. \n6. FM and Music Player : For a mobile of this low costs finding these options make is more wantable. FM Player has storable . Even though mp3 playback quality it not great, it is good enough , better than i expected from a dumb phone.   \nCons: \n1.Call Sound: I found the sound of speaker on the other side to be little low . Have to press the piece to my ear to hear them clearly. Better use a earset to take the call. \n2.Reception : At times the signal reception is poor and drops the calls when the signal is weak. \n3.Music Player : Doesn't play protected mp3 files. In the shuffle mode, the player doesn't remember the prev track. There is no rewind or fast forward or stop . There is just pause/play. Pause acts as stop here. From the lock screen music could be changed only when you wake it up from sleep. When in sleep it the D-pad controls only the volume. Could have been more comfortable if D-pad mapping inside the player had been preserved in the sleep mode too. \n4.Contacts : We can't store more than one number for a contact. Maybe that is expected. The number of char in the name of contact is very limited ( i guess it is something like 15 , not very sure ).  \n5.Notification : Notifications of SMS or Missed Call on the lockscreen doesn't work most of the time. I had to unlock the screen everytime to find out if there has been any such event that i missed . \n6.FM : The signal reception is very mediocre. I had to balance the wire of my headset to get a clear reception. Otherwise this is decent. \n7. Sim : The size of sim is bother. It is normal sim , not a micro/nano sim. You had to get a adapter if you need to use this a substitute for your smartphone. \n8. Dual Sim: This is DSS. One sim becomes inactive ( switched off ) when you take a call in the other .   \nIf you can live with all the above cons like me , then this phone is worth the money.

", "\n I ordered this phone on reading it's features on Flipkart but upon receiving in hand, I actually got to know that it's not even that great! I would like to clear some possible misconceptions:  \n1) Bluetooth: The BT in this phone only supports file transfers (Audio and Video - Other files might be supported, however I didn't try yet) and not audio headsets.  \n2) Music: Yes, it has an in built MP3 player which plays the MP3s well and has a My Favourite playlist support. It also has a radio with 30 savable radio stations.  \n3) Video: Although it has an in-built Video player, still, it only detects MP4, AVI and plays only AVI (I only tried MP4, MKV &amp; AVI till now). \n4) Speakers: Yeah! One of the things that I liked of this phone is that its speakers are good. It's better than Samsung Galaxy Note 1. Ear - piece volume is also good.  \n5) Nokia OS: Yeah! Another thing of this phone that I liked. The new Nokia OS in this phone. It has lock screen controls i.e. We can change the song or volume even when the screen is locked or even respond to messages and missed calls keeping the screen locked.  \n6) Pre-loaded games: Only Snake Xenzia is the game pre-loaded in this phone.  \n7) Features: Yes! As usual, a very costly phone. It supports Dual SIM (Both are Normal SIM slots) but lack settings related to them. We can't set default SIMs or close one SIM or even flight mode is not supported. In call, only loudspeaker is supported i.e. no conference calling, etc.  \n8) Customization: Well, we can change the wallpapers - We can choose only from one of the three very dull-looking wallpapers. We can't choose any photo from SD card.  \n9) Quality &amp; Design: Yes, it's design is good and quality is also good.  \n10) USB: I would directly say that the USB port of this phone should be used only for charging the phone and not for file transfers. Although, it supports file transfers, but, the speed of copying files onto the SD card is much slower. I have a Class 4 SD card with a writing speed of 4-6 MB/s but I am able to copy files (Movies &amp; Songs) in this phone at 400-600 KB/s. \nFinal verdict: Guys, this phone is just like the older Nokia phones only with a Dual SIM and SD card support and with some minor OS changes. Instead go for other companies like Micromax, etc. which would give you much better features like camera, etc. in low cost.

Hence, it goes without saying that I have been an Android user since stone age! I won't go into the usual boring stuffs of megapixels, ppi, number of cores, how much ram or that age old battle of iOS vs Android. My views are completely based on using the phone since a month as my daily driver. I have always believed that in terms of design &amp; choice of materials, Apple is second to none. The touch &amp; feel of the anodised aluminium can't be described with mere words. But there's a flip side to it of being extremely slippery. I haven't seen a smartphone display with such accurate colours &amp; such insane amount of brightness output which gives it a huge boon for sunlight legibility. Apple has been known for creating industry leading smartphone cameras and I was mighty impressed with the focussing power, low light image quality &amp; the ability to snap great looking photos consistently. Now, if there's one thing that I was completely blown away was the performance. It is so buttery smooth. I have played some of the most graphic intensive games like Modern Combat 5, Asphalt 8, Max Payne, etc and that too, around 2 hours straight on many occasions &amp; i didn't encounter a single frame drop or lag or heating issues. I used to hear about it but only after having experienced it myself that I agree that gaming is literally on a different level altogether on iOS. Coming to battery life, even for a heavy user like me, there hasn't been a single day where I have been able to discharge the battery completely. But what's even better is the unreal standby time. I go to sleep with around 20% charge and wake up after 7-8 hours with 19% charge still left!  \nP.S. - The price disparity between Apple products in India &amp; a country like USA is just plain jane stupid. 71k on a phone which you will be using for not more than 2 years is just too much no matter how great the phone is.

", "\n First of all Flipkart service and delivery time is upto the mark. Thank you Flipkart for continuing your great service.   \nI am using this phone from last 2 weeks. Here is what I experience:   \nPROs :   \n1) Design is very good. The Fit Home UI provided by Panasonic helps you to access almost all the apps and other functionality using a thumb, which is very impressive.   \n2) Display is awesome. I have seen as well as used many HD screen mobiles but havent seen such great clarity HD display before. HD videos play smoothly and you get that great feeling of watching High Def quality.   \n3) Battery Life : I find it surprising that this phone consumes a way less battery for an android phone with this specs. Battery doesnt drain drastically when it goes below 15%. Havent tested it with heavy usage till now but I am damn sure that battery consumption is very less. I can carry this phone without charging for atleast 12 hours (mostly on wifi, single SIM, heavy usage of whatsapp, facebook on chrome).   \n4) Android kitkat : I think fuss about android lollipop is just way too high. Kitkat gives a great experience on this phone. Right from lock screen to dialer, everything is perfect.   \n5) Camera and Video quality is really good. Rear camera (8MP) gives very good quality pics and videos in daylight but under low light the quality goes down. Flash works very well. Front camera (5MP) gives exactly what you expect from it. I am satisfied with camera quality but little bit disappointed about its performance under low light.   \n6) Screen guard and mobile cover comes up with mobile phone. Cover is a decent one so as the screen guard.   \n7) Game playing experience is very good. I tried contract killer sniper and it runs buttery smooth. No lags at all.   \nCONs:   \n1) Sound : For a music lover like me, this is a disaster. Output on headphones is very low. Quality is good but output is very low.   \n2) Phone gets warm (not hot) near rear camera while playing games/videos for a long time.   \n3) Touch becomes non-responsive for a while when you connect it to charging.

I was so used to my Moto X 1st gen that this is an awesome upgrade to my older one. \nMy brother has a One Plus One and though I liked it, it was bit too large for me.    \nMy suggestion would be, to not go only by specs, the Moto X delivers just as good as the OPO or the Mi4,at times just excels.  \nI was worried about the battery life of Moto X 2014. I kept a black wallpaper to reduce battery usage. I got the Lollipop 5.1 update and keep the battery saver on. Since the lollipop 5.1 has a lot of white background, i switched to Nova launcher (which i like more than the default one). My 2G is always enabled and when at home the 3G is always on. I make and receive about 4-5 calls a day and my battery lasts me more than 24 hours. Very Very happy with it.    \nThanks to the review comments from some people which were very encouraging in making this decision to buy this phone. Writing this review after 2 weeks of usage.  \nI would recommend this to any normal user, who doesn't flash ROMs like changing clothes, who doesn't want customization to the core, this is the phone which will keep you happy till you own it.     "], ["Santhosh Kumar", "Best of one kind ", "\n The Moto X's Moto Display is absolutely useful. You won't believe how helpful it is until you have used it. And on an average it use less battery than when you repeatedly wake up the phone to check notifications.   \nAudio: The frontal speaker is very loud and clear. It has a rich output but not as good as HTC One M8 tough. But having used to M8's sound I personally didn't find it to be that bad. Its more than average. The phone comes with very ergonomic earphone with reasonably deep bass but it feels cheap and lacks a remote to control music playback like &quot;next&quot;, &quot;forward&quot;, &quot;back&quot; etc. The Phone's earpiece is just a bit low in volume. That would mean you &quot;might&quot; struggle hearing in a loud place, but then it has a benefit that the other party's voice is not heard even in a quite room with people in it e.g. conference rooms etc. "], ["Abhishek Dubey", "Entirely satisfied.

If you wanna share Music file then there is no provision in the media player using which the one can share the file. for this one has to download any folder viewer software using which he/she can share the file.  \n2. Moto voice command works only when you are in the isolated room with now disturbing sound around. \n3. If i compare MOTO touch with HTC, then HTC shows much much better response. \n4.

"], ["Dipanjan Banerjee", "The ideal culmination of the smaller iPhones &amp; the larger iPads ", "\n I am a big guy with big hands so buying a super sized smartphone was a no brainer for me. Hence, it goes without saying that I have been an Android user since stone age! I won't go into the usual boring stuffs of megapixels, ppi, number of cores, how much ram or that age old battle of iOS vs Android. My views are completely based on using the phone since a month as my daily driver. I have always believed that in terms of design &amp; choice of materials, Apple is second to none. The touch &amp; feel of the anodised aluminium can't be described with mere words. But there's a flip side to it of being extremely slippery. I haven't seen a smartphone display with such accurate colours &amp; such insane amount of brightness output which gives it a huge boon for sunlight legibility. Apple has been known for creating industry leading smartphone cameras and I was mighty impressed with the focussing power, low light image quality &amp; the ability to snap great looking photos consistently. Now, if there's one thing that I was completely blown away was the performance. It is so buttery smooth. I have played some of the most graphic intensive games like Modern Combat 5, Asphalt 8, Max Payne, etc and that too, around 2 hours straight on many occasions &amp; i didn't encounter a single frame drop or lag or heating issues. I used to hear about it but only after having experienced it myself that I agree that gaming is literally on a different level altogether on iOS. Coming to battery life, even for a heavy user like me, there hasn't been a single day where I have been able to discharge the battery completely. But what's even better is the unreal standby time. I go to sleep with around 20% charge and wake up after 7-8 hours with 19% charge still left!  \nP.S. - The price disparity between Apple products in India &amp; a country like USA is just plain jane stupid. 71k on a phone which you will be using for not more than 2 years is just too much no matter how great the phone is. All those issues regarding the bend-gate was way too much blown out of proportion.

", "\n First of all Flipkart service and delivery time is upto the mark. Thank you Flipkart for continuing your great service.   \nI am using this phone from last 2 weeks. Here is what I experience:   \nPROs :   \n1) Design is very good. The Fit Home UI provided by Panasonic helps you to access almost all the apps and other functionality using a thumb, which is very impressive.   \n2) Display is awesome. I have seen as well as used many HD screen mobiles but havent seen such great clarity HD display before. HD videos play smoothly and you get that great feeling of watching High Def quality.   \n3) Battery Life : I find it surprising that this phone consumes a way less battery for an android phone with this specs. Battery doesnt drain drastically when it goes below 15%. Havent tested it with heavy usage till now but I am damn sure that battery consumption is very less. I can carry this phone without charging for atleast 12 hours (mostly on wifi, single SIM, heavy usage of whatsapp, facebook on chrome).   \n4) Android kitkat : I think fuss about android lollipop is just way too high. Kitkat gives a great experience on this phone. Right from lock screen to dialer, everything is perfect.   \n5) Camera and Video quality is really good. Rear camera (8MP) gives very good quality pics and videos in daylight but under low light the quality goes down. Flash works very well. Front camera (5MP) gives exactly what you expect from it. I am satisfied with camera quality but little bit disappointed about its performance under low light.   \n6) Screen guard and mobile cover comes up with mobile phone. Cover is a decent one so as the screen guard.   \n7) Game playing experience is very good. I tried contract killer sniper and it runs buttery smooth. No lags at all.   \nCONs:   \n1) Sound : For a music lover like me, this is a disaster. Output on headphones is very low. Quality is good but output is very low.   \n2) Phone gets warm (not hot) near rear camera while playing games/videos for a long time.   \n3) Touch becomes non-responsive for a while when you connect it to charging.

"], ["Hari Warrier", "Best phone I've owned so far, but.. ", "\n These are my thoughts about some of the features of S6.    \nBattery Life    \nBattery life sucks - Samsung has betrayed the faithful by not opting for removable battery in S6. The beautiful uni body glass and Aluminium design would simply not possible with a removable back cover. So is the trade-off making sense? Not at all, according to me. I start my day with a 100% charge and with quite average use, I hardly get to 25% by evening and less than 15% with somewhat medium use. I know that any usage involving watching half an hour of videos on top of my usage will completely drain the battery. This is totally unacceptable.    \nTo mitigate this in a way, the fast charger (included in the retail package) charges the phone from 10% to 70% in about half an hour. The power saving mode will make your phone last easily a day with quite above average usage. The mode saves battery life by dimming the display, reducing the frequency of push notifications, turning off vibration and throttling the processor. Even with the throttled processor, the performance (As checked with Antutu) is good.    \nHowever, I would rather trade off design flashiness for a solid day long battery. Oh..I miss those old phones (we derisively now call them brick phones) whose 3150 mAh  \nbattery easily lasted for few days..    \nThe sealed battery will also be an issue two years down the line when the battery capacity diminishes. This could spell doom for those users who continue using phones for 2+ years. My friend in office is one such crazy guy, who sold the S6 he got after renewing the contract and stuck on with his old trusty S4. His S4 is as good as new for him with a new battery and roll back of the OS from Lolipop to kit kat. A very happy man walked out of office that day.    \nI will miss that for sure. And battery &quot;range anxiety&quot; bugs me in the evening..   \nNon exapandable memory    \nAgain the advancement of the memory interface to faster SSD type tech has necessitated Samsung to ditch support for slower eMMC based expandable storage. Unlike the dictatorial Apple, which starts their iPhone line-up with only a puny 16GB version the Galaxy S6 starts with 32GB. I installed all the usual suspects and then some and am still left with 16 GB of usable storage, which is enough for 1-2 high quality games, lot of songs and movies. So really for me, the 32GB storage is sufficient for my use, and I think would suffice for most users. Again with most of the files getting backed up in cloud (115 GB of skydrive is standard with each S6), it is also not so difficult to delete those lengthy videos and tour pics thus saving the memory. I am so far perfectly OK with the storage.    \nFull back glass design    \nThe phone feels a bit slippery in hand. And many drop tests show how fragile is the back and front glass sheets of S6 are to impact stresses. I am totally against covering up this beauty in a tasteless protective sheath, but I may have to do it with the long term ownership of the phone in mind. So the tradeoff of fragile but beautiful design is appearing not so good for me.    \nIt is a maxim of the tech world that you pay quite high price for an incremental intergenerational performance boost, which is the practised norm as far as economics of product launches are concerned. It is easy to add features that look flashy and gimmicky but has very less inherent value, but the real deep changes on the internals usually take a back seat in one generation to next.    \nHowever, this maxim is turned upside down by the Galaxy S6 with a phenomenal 50% performance advantage in CPU/GPU side and 240% advantage in memory throughput over its predecessor (Galaxy S5 and Note 4, both were the leading phones of 2014) as tested in Geekbench (I got 4908 in Multi-Core score with my S6). Ive never encountered a phone in the evolutionary cycle in Android ecosystem with such brute performance advantage over its predecessor, be it the pioneering 14nm LPE process used in SOC, the fast and latest gen LPDDR4 memory replacing the old eMMC based interface with faster SSD type solution and the full 64 bit processor all of which makes it future proof as far as my product buying cycle is concerned.    \nI would've rated in 3.5 stars but Flipkart does not allow me giving that rating. I cant rate a 3.0, since S6 is one of the best phones out there and best Ive ever owned. So I rate this 4.0 and looking back at the review and my happiness and satisfaction in using this magnificently fast and gorgeous looking phone, I think I am justified too. "], ["Kaustav Guha", "The best Galaxy yet ! ", "\n I got this from a offline store, and got a free wireless charger, samsung is giving it for free not the store, hence i donot understand why Flipkart is not, this is the only reason infact i bought it from a offline store, the prices are very similar.   \nAbout the phone: \nPros:   \n1. Superb screen, the best ever, i have user Iphone 5S and it certainly trumps that, don't know much about the 6.   \n2. Fabulous camera, in auto stabilization mode the lens moves around inside its housing to provide you a shake-free video.   \n3. The sound quality of the phone through the earphones and also loud speaker is pretty good, there are lots of adjustments for the earphones, there is also something called adaptive sound which fine tunes the eqalizer according to the earphones and make a very basic earphone also sound good.   \n4. The design, to say the least its the best looking device Samsung has made, ever; no plastic at all, none. All glass and aluminum.   \n5. The processor is really good coupled with the 3gb of RAM, it doeseverything asked for, without breaking a sweat.   \n6. I have the 32 GB version, out of which 25 gb is user-useable, its more than enough, but a microSD wouldn't be too bad.   \n7. The sensors on this device are brilliant, the heart rate sensor can not only tell your pulse but alsothe oxygen count in your blood ! The fingerprint reader does not need a full swipe like in S5, now it works with just a tap and its pretty good !   \n8. Android lollipop with touch wiz is good, and the touch wiz is not that heavy like that in earlier galaxy devices, hence its smooth as well as refined.   \n9. Videos shot in slow motion are very very good !   \n10. It's got themes ! and they just don't change the wallpaper, but the default application thumbnails and the dailer screen as well.   \n11. The infrared blaster is very usefull, and the smart remote app gets your tv schedule too so that you can directly move to a channel just by tapping on it on your phone !   \n12. I have the clear view case, and its brilliant, you can receive calls on it( \ni.e. no need to open the flap.) But has no ugly cut-out like the oder cases, it is expensive, but like other cases it does not spoil the looks of the phone.   \nNothing is perfect, and this is no exception, hence:   \nCons:   \n1. S5 was waterproof this just throws this out of the window for the sake of good looks.   \n2. A microSD card support is sorely missed ! 32 or 64 or 128GB is a lot ! But the idea of adding storage as you need its very much missed !   \n3. Its got Gorilla glass 4 but got a few scratches on the front pannel in 2 days, and i did not drop it even by an inch, you will have to invest in a good tempered glass screen protector !   \n4. I find putting the microUSB, loud speaker, microphone and headphone jack, all at the bottom is a bit of a overkill, but it does make it look fabulous beacause of its clean edges !   \nThese are just minor niggles and you can live with it, and who has a phone without a screen guard ?   \nIf you want it just get it, One of the best smartphones that money can buy today !

Graphic intensive games perform well and the device works smoothly. But the customised Android is definitely not as refined as iOS. Many basic apps have two versions, one by Samsung and another by Google.   \nThe size is neither comfortable to use with one hand, nor does it require two hands properly.

Here's the reason why I chose S6:   \n1. Camera: Clearly the better of the two. Samsung has had a history of good camera's and it doesn't disappoint.  \n2. Processor: With an antutu rating in the 67k+ range, its the fastet phone there is, and even the mediatek processor from m9+ doesnt come close. \n3. Design: Its a newer fresher design, and so good to hold. \n4. Battery: even though the battery is smaller, it has fast charging, means I can charge to 50% in about 20 minutes.  \n5. Touchwiz is much improved. If you're ruing the old heavily loaded GUIs with a lot of apps, its done a good task of hiding them and making it look classy. \n6. Split Screen. This is just for show value but definitely a good option.   \nMy only concern will arrive 2 years later, when the phone is old and Samsung will stop OTA updates, which it has a history of doing. Just hope that it doesnt happen for this one, hence the 4 stars. "], ["mg", "Buy to prove a fool out of u. ", "\n Thats the new tag line of this company.

No MHL 3 / HDMI support(Like Note 4) \nMeans you cannot connect your phone with TV THROUGH HDMI PORT and enjoy its content via screen mirroring.   \n(Please Note: Wireless Screen Mirroring still works, but MHL is far better especially when you play high frame rate games, where frame drop can make you lose the game, also using Wi-Fi with MHL is not a problem as in case of wireless connection) \nSamsung Galaxy S6 / S6 Edge does NOT have MHL 3 or any MHL at all. It has been erroneously mentioned in SamMobile article (Reasons to upgrade from the Samsung Galaxy S4 to the Galaxy S6 or S6 edge).   \n2.) No USB 3 or USB 3.1 &amp; also No USB type C \nMany would argue that USB 3 was big and clunky, but Samsung could have provided USB 3 or even faster USB 3.1 with a USB type C connector. It is reversible, faster and can carry MHL 3 for streaming 4K to your TV. Phones with such features have already hit the market.(USB 3.0 was present on Note 3 &amp; S5)   \n3.) No IP67, No Dustproofing &amp; No Waterproofing(Was present in Galaxy S5 &amp; Sony phones)   \n4.) No user removable battery.   \n5.) No MicroSD card slot to expand memory.   \n6.) No Glove Mode or way to increase screen touch sensitivity(Was present in all flagship Samsung phone till now)   \n7.) No LED Notification indicator menu \nLED notification indicator is present, but the menu to customise is now absent.   \n8.) Smaller Battery than S5.   \n9.) Another BIG Drawback / Con is increased length of the phone. Its 143+ mm, while the S4 was very compact in dimensions. S4 was about 136+ mm in length.   \nBelieve me, it does make a difference in handling &amp; keeping it in the pocket.   \n10.) It is not a durable phone, at-least not as durable as previous flagship phones from Samsung. This is amply clear from various drop tests.   \nHope Samsung incorporates these features in the upcoming Note 5 and S7. "], ["Rahul Dey", "The best Galaxy S yet ", "\n First to those reviewing this product without buying it. Just stop. Buy it, use it, and then write an honest review. Till then grapes will be sour for you guys.  \nThe S6 is a superphone, the screen is crisp and colors are vivid, performance is blazingly fast, and camera is terrific. The design (while controversially borrowed from the iPhone) is exquisite. The 2.5D curved glass one front and back literally melts into the chamfered aluminium edges. The sturdy build inspires confidence when the phone is held. It is undoubtedly the best android phone on the market.  \nI used to own an S2, S4, and Note 3 before and then got a Mi3 because I was tired of Samsung's devices.

"], ["Sahal Mohamed", "Terrific phone ", "\n Samsung comes back with a bang \nFinally, Samsung decided to listen to the frequent woes by the users to get a change in the usual form factor using plastic. Though S5 wasn't a bad phone, its design was the reason why Samsung lost its top position as a smartphone vendor. So Samsung beautifully crafted S6 in metal and glass added on with the best specs any phone can get right now.    \nDesign: \nMetal and glass is a terrific combination. Sony had showed us that earlier with Xperia Z3. Samsung follows the suit with an elegant design. It depends on the perspective, but its a huge leap forward from the S5.   \nPerformance: \nPerformance is crispy and smooth with the new trimmed down Touchwiz. I tried installing numerous apps and never experienced any sorts of lag. It tops almost all benchmarks and real life performance is really good as well.   \nDisplay: \nS6 has arguably the best display currently. 2k resolution makes the display so hsarp and it really reflects while reading e-books or while web browsing. 1080p would have sufficed on this 5.1&quot; screen, but having 2k wouldn't hurt though.   \nCamera: \nThis is the best part of this phone. S6 takes mind blowing pictures both during bright an d low light conditions. Auto HDR and tracking Auto Focus are really good and all these lets even an amateur photographer take a good snap. Video quality is quite good as well but 32 gb storage might limit the recording 4k videos to an extent.   \nUI: \nTouchwiz has improved a lot and its a lot crispier than its predecessors. Touchwiz includes various features that are missed out in the stock Lollipop like the clear all option in recent apps. The newly added theme support raises the interests if you're into changing the UI frequently. Various goodies like multi window, Smart stay, Smart alert etc are still present in S6.Biggest con i found here was that I couldn't find an option to arrange the apps alphabetically which is really needed if we have too many apps. Hope they brings it in the next update.   \nBattery: \n2550 mah battery definitely raises some eyebrows. But it definitely lasts an entire with a normal usage of calls, browsing and gaming. It might be due to the better optimization or the latest 14 nm Exynos 7420 which has better efficiency. And the battery being non removable isn't really a deal breaker for me, as long as it gives good backup. But I hope the replacement isn't gonna be too expensive if its required.   \nStorage: \nMissing out external SD Card support could be a great con for many. But if that was done to provide better performance(S6 uses UFS 2.0 which provides thrice the reading and writing speed compared to the rest), it can forgiven. But the pricing for higher memory options are quite steep.   \nOverall Galaxy S6 is a perfect offering by Samsung with a few cons which are definitely overshadowed by its pros. The overheating issues about Snapdragon 810 in HTC M9 and other flagships about to be released might sway the wind in Samsung's direction. If you want a premium flagship worth the money, go for this phone. It is definitely better than other phones in this price range.   \nVerdict: Go for it!

No one designs phones like HTC , period. The white color looks stunning with double tone colors..

There are some software features which make it stand out from others.    \nSOFTWARE :: HTC sense is the smoothest bloat UI in market, dont belive me ? Google the reviews..I have been using their smartphoens for 3 years now and They are super fast without any lags.  \nDISPLAY :: Display is not full HD (They have to cut the costs somewhere) but its good. It has 5.5 inch sceen which is great to watch movies.  \nSOUND :: BoomSound, need I say more?? for those who do not know, BOOMSOUND is absolutely killer and the best sound system you will find on any smartphone. They are loud, crisp and the lows, mids and highs are perfect.  \nCONNECTIVITY:: 4G at this price?? unbelievable for an HTC device. It supports all other connectivity options like WiFi, 3G, Bluetooth etc  \nBATTERY :: 2600 mAh seems small but M8 has the same battery with full HD screen and lasts for more than 1 day.

And who loves to take selfie can prefer this. \n3) No heating problem. ( Note that I haven't installed any games on mobile. Not sure how it will be while playing games). \n4) HTC Boom sound will make you feel good with it. \n5) Battery Backup- \n - If you are not using internet, battery will not be an issue atleast for two to \n three days.  \n - If you are using internet, on normal case the battery will service for the day time, I  \n mean from 9 to 9. If you are continuosly using the internet then battery will be thr \n only for 5 to 6 hours. \n I feels okay with this. And we cant expect more on 5.5 Full HD display device. \n6) No hanging problem. Am using this for 5+ months now and never felt any such issues, \n and you can easily switch from one app to another. \n7) We are having dual sim facilith where as both ports will support GSM sim cards. \n8) Unlimited storage capacity. Expandable up to 128 GB. \n9) Comes up with latest Android OS which can be updated later with new versions. \n10) And as last, the LOOK.. You will just love it. Weight less. Really Cute and stylish \n look which will make you feel that you are the owner of an awesome product.   \nBads:   \nTo be frank I didnt feel any to list down here... But still am saying which can be improved a little more....   \n1) Battery - while using the internet continuosly the battery will service only for an avaerage of 5 hours ( that to needs to check ) \n2) If they provide flash for rear camera it would be more awesome ;) :P \n3) I dont know what to say more guyss.. Just check other reviews for more negatives. I \n dont have any to share.....   \nThats it. Am winding up my writting. You can go for it.. If you get this product for around 20K it would be best product. So keep an eye on it and with any offers you will get it for 20K then join with our HTC family without any doubts....

In this review, I am not going to tell the specs of these smartphone, since you all aware of it. \nFirst of all, thanks to Flipkart for delivering my product within the estimated time of delivery. \nComing to the product,  \nIt was an awesome XPERIENCE while using my XPERIA Z2. I have already used HTC desire S for the past 3 years and I have gone many research about smartphones before buying it. Since I am a hardcore user, this smartphone suits me a lot. I have listed some important things which will be helpful for those people who wish to buy XPERIA Z2. \n1) HIGH END GAMES runs smooth with no lag, but while playing any games there is a bit lag at the beginning. But after few seconds it becomes lag free. I have played ASPHALT 8, DEAD TRIGGER, MODERN KOMBAT X. All these games works fine. \n2) USER INTERFACE is buttery smooth and works fine. New and popular eye catchy theme launchers are available which will make your xperia more colorful. \n3) coming to the CAMERA performance, many camera features are added in this smartphone like background defocus, AR effect,creative effect,time shift burst, sweep panorama, Last but not the least, it can record ULTRA HD videos (i.e) 4K videos with Rear facing camera which is 20.7 MP :-O I have also took selfies and videos UNDERWATER. Those pics and videos are excellent.  \nwhile coming to the Front facing camera, I am bit disappointed with its clarity. i noticed Some pixelations while viewing through it. Again, it may be rectified by making a system update. \n4)BUILD QUALITY is brilliant. i have accidentally dropped on the concrete floor 3 times. but it works fine. And the important thing is that i have tested it underwater since it is a water resistant phone.  \n5) DISPLAY the display of this xperia z2 is seems to be quiet brilliant since it has full HD resolution. It also has the feature of x-reality engine which make the picture and videos look vibrant and sharp. I enjoyed very much while watching videos and playing games. \n6) SOUND : the sound clarity from the speaker is good but not excellent. But the headphone sound output is marvelous. while i heard songs through the headset i became speechless. :-*  \n7) CALL CLARITY : call clarity is good enough and noise cancellation microphone works fine. The only problem is that Sony provided in-the ear headphone but it is not a noise cancellation ear phones. The other person in the call and myself noticed some kind of noises when I touch or rub my microphone. Even the headsets with low price range does not have this problem. \n8) BATTERY. I have to admit truly. The battery backup is Damn good. with normal usage you would get 1 and 1/2 days and with heavy usage with internet, gaming etc you would get 1 day.Using stamina mode, low battery mode you can save the last juice of the battery. Hats off to 3200mAh battery.  \nFinally, my ratings are \nGAMING 9/10 \nUI 9/10 \nCAMERA 8/10 \nDISPLAY 10/10 \nSOUND 8/10 \nCALL CLARITY 8/10 \nBATTERY 9/10. \nIf you are plannning to buy this gadget, Blindly go for it.  \nThank you :-)    "], ["Syam S Nair", "SUPERBB PRODUCT ", "\n amazing mobile , good battery back up ,camera , walkman aplication is superbbb , \nover all nice product , thanks sony , iam used in 3g , games , batery is not heated "], ["ShrungaRaj Chi...", "IM NOT SURE IF IVE RECEIVED A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT ", "\n IN THE TWO DAYS OF USAGE, THE SIM FLAP CAME OUT AND AFTER A FEW DAYS THE MEMORY SLOT TOO.

Display: superb!!!; believe it or not; for my naked eyes; it looks better than my IPad Mini 2 &amp; Note 2!!!   \n2. Battery: I love it; decent battery back in the first two days of use. Remember, for all smart phones, battery lasts for anything more than a day is fine.   \n3. Smart Band: Who told it is waste; it is nice; but you need to know how it is used and it is not just the Media player, it can be used with other applications as well.    \n4. Look: It looks very slim &amp; sexy; I really love it.   \n5. Camera: Pretty nice 8MP camera with this price tag; it won't disappoint you for sure.   \n6. Touch: Is butter smooth at this point of time for me.   \n7. Build Quality: Yes; it is perfect. Guys who are comparing this phone with Lava, Micromax etc... by seeing its specs; it is not that you see everything on paper; it is all about the quality &amp; performance. I would definitely recommend you all to go with a renowned brand like Samsung, Sony, HTC etc...    \n8. Sound: Pretty nice sound clarity; though I would say none of the phones I ever purchased doesn't match with the sound quality of my old Sony Ericsson W610I   \nCons:   \n1. Headphone: This is one thing I found bad about this phone, out of box headphone is not up to mark; looks like Sony want us to pay for a premium headphone.   \n2. No Android Lollipop update or no news from Sony about the update yet; but Android 4.4 (you can update the phone to 4.4 though out of box is 4.2) is one of the most stable Android OS as of now.   \n3. Looks like there are not enough apps utilizing the features of Smart Band yet; only a few from Sony itself.   \nOver all I'm VERY MUCH SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE \u00ef\u0081\u008a \u00ef\u0081\u008a \u00ef\u0081\u008a \nSo, guys stop blaming; buy it, use it and FEEL IT!! \nAs always hats off to FLIPKART once again for a WONDERFUL GREAT DEAL!!!!

Its a unique brand.Performance of the cellphone can't be reached by other mobiles as it contains 1 gb ram. Moreover retina display which gives crystal clear displays.Once phone is purchased surely the life of mobile is more than 7 years. Apple forward thinking concept can be seen in phone , If you dont have an iphone, you dont have iphone. Seriously phone is far better than any other phone "], ["Vivek", "Finally - made the switch to iOS and quite comfortable with it ", "\n First things first - the delivery was prompt and it was from AAA deals (had opted for in-a-day delivery). The phone is very sleek and thin - might need a case if you have slippery hands. The build quality is excellent. Below review is from my own experience of switching from Galaxy S3 to this iphone 6+.    \nThe cons:  \n1. The phone is big - if you have small hands/prefer smaller phones in general, this is not for you (especially existing iphone users - consider iphone 6 maybe). Existing Galaxy/Note series/Nexus 6 fans however might find it easy enough to get used to but..  \n2. iOS \nBeing an Android user myself till now, I think the features offered by iOS are nowhere a match for Android.. Power users will have to get used iOS a little. And most features that are in built into Android/Cyanogen are offered by paid apps in case of iOS.  \n3. Data \nAlthough this is related to point 2 (iOS) rather than the phone itself, found it that big a deal to mention it separately.. iOS gobbles up data like mad, incremental upgrades aren't as efficient as Android (OS updates) and even regular apps are way heavier.. For e.g. consider this, Google sheets, that's 30-40 MB on android, is more than 110 MB in iOS. Considering android has to support more resolutions and phone models than iphone, I think this is gross inefficiency..  \nThe pros: \nThe advantages now: \n1. Battery: \nThe phone lasts 1.5-2 days easily with both location and background app refresh (sync) on all the time. My phone still has 9% despite 8 hours of usage and 32 hours of standby (after plugged out of full charge yesterday morning). That's a good 40 hours of usage. On the other hand, I'm yet to hear about an android phone that lasts more than a day with Sync, Google now and location set to on - even the nexus 6 would barely last a few hours more than a day.. This is not an understatement - this is easily the best phone in terms of battery life today (To be fair, worthy competitors in android are Note 4, Oneplus One, Nexus 6 &amp; Moto Turbo - all of them come close but not quite matching up to this)  \n2. Camera: \nThe camera is still 8 MP, but has digital and optical image stabilization. Shoots fast and quite good - functions so smoothly. Low light photography works great. The only better phone cameras out there (in Android) are Galaxy s6 and LG G4. And considering this is just 8 MP but still matches up with the best cameras out there, the file size difference is quite an advantage..  \n3. iOS: \nAlthough it has its pains, iOS still has its advantages - the entire OS feels very smooth and lag free (can't stress this enough - even the best of the Android phones starts lagging after six months or so). Even other minor features - the passbook, Stocks, Apple health all of them have equivalent Android apps, but the tight integration with the core OS is much better here. Also - iTunes sync - a lot of people might hate it, but this is still the best software to sync playlists and songs. To give you an example, you can even set a track to play only between the start of minute 2 and 3 on your desktop, and the same will get synced on to your iphone/ipod (tried removing preludes in a song anyone?)  \nSo yes, this phone has its advantages and disadvantages - but at the end of the day if you just want a smartphone to last long, shoot great photos and are ready to experiment with iOS a little, I think this is for you. Considering the best android phones are almost the same price (S6/S6 edge) and given that they run Touchwiz, this decision was a no-brainer after all :) "], ["Kunal Saini", "Iphone 6 plus ", "\n excellent phone as you all know apple make always best phone in mobile industry..   \nExcellent camra, bettery backup, display quality, overall excellent phone "], ["Abhishek verma", "good product &amp; exactly same as described ", "\n good product &amp; exactly same as described. \ngood packing with very very fast delivery.   \ngood product &amp; exactly same as described. \ngood packing with very very fast delivery.

"], ["Dipanjan Banerjee", "The ideal culmination of the smaller iPhones &amp; the larger iPads ", "\n I am a big guy with big hands so buying a super sized smartphone was a no brainer for me. Hence, it goes without saying that I have been an Android user since stone age! I won't go into the usual boring stuffs of megapixels, ppi, number of cores, how much ram or that age old battle of iOS vs Android. My views are completely based on using the phone since a month as my daily driver. I have always believed that in terms of design &amp; choice of materials, Apple is second to none. The touch &amp; feel of the anodised aluminium can't be described with mere words. But there's a flip side to it of being extremely slippery. I haven't seen a smartphone display with such accurate colours &amp; such insane amount of brightness output which gives it a huge boon for sunlight legibility. Apple has been known for creating industry leading smartphone cameras and I was mighty impressed with the focussing power, low light image quality &amp; the ability to snap great looking photos consistently. Now, if there's one thing that I was completely blown away was the performance. It is so buttery smooth. I have played some of the most graphic intensive games like Modern Combat 5, Asphalt 8, Max Payne, etc and that too, around 2 hours straight on many occasions &amp; i didn't encounter a single frame drop or lag or heating issues. I used to hear about it but only after having experienced it myself that I agree that gaming is literally on a different level altogether on iOS. Coming to battery life, even for a heavy user like me, there hasn't been a single day where I have been able to discharge the battery completely. But what's even better is the unreal standby time. I go to sleep with around 20% charge and wake up after 7-8 hours with 19% charge still left!  \nP.S. - The price disparity between Apple products in India &amp; a country like USA is just plain jane stupid. 71k on a phone which you will be using for not more than 2 years is just too much no matter how great the phone is. All those issues regarding the bend-gate was way too much blown out of proportion.

But it is very hard to judge best android phone under budget. Let's start with android phone ZTE Blade G2 V880H.    \nLook And design.   \nThis android phone is developed by Chinese manufacture ZTE. First of all the device look is very gorgeous and stunning, device come with 4.5 inch IPS display, screen density 240 dpi. It's back cover come with black matt finish which quite handy to hold the phone in hand. The right hand side of device we get power button, And left hand side it has volume up and down button, On front of device it has VGA camera on top right, and top left we have sensors. On top there is 3.5mm phone Jack for headsets or earphone. Company done great job for device look. It feel very good in hand. Device look and design are very impressive.   \nCall quality, Speaker, In earphone quality.   \nHere we get impress too, the call quality of mobile phone is adequate, Speaker sound is good but not too loud, But it is quite clear. That's means we have to choose right ringtone to get much from phone speaker. And about earphone quality which come with device is OK, I used creative EP - 630 and Nokia WH - 205 for testing of audio quality of phone through 3.5mm phone Jack. It really surprising, it audio quality almost alike my Sony mp3 player. But the music player come with this device it have Equaliser as well as bass boost, 3D effect and Preset Reverb. All these things deliver premium quality on earphone or headsets. Overall audio is astonishing.   \nCamera Quality.   \nNow, Let's move to camera quality. For outdoors photographs, In morning and at noon the photo capturing is brilliant, But at night it have flashlights for capturing image. One can get better shots only by using perfect setting of camera option for photographs capturing. Now, About camera video quality, Video recording is not good, It's work well only need to do lots of tweaking. During video camera testing I was got neutral video, may be little bit distorted video. Generally camera is good for image capturing. But not all for video recording.   \nBuild Quality And Battery.   \nThis is the matter of device quality. The build quality of device is excellent. Here ZTE Company done wonderful and fair work for related to build quality of device as compare to many other mobile phone company like Samsung, Nokia, Sony, Micromax, lava and etc. And it has 2000mAh Li - ion battery, Anyone can get full day battery backup under mixed usages. But somebody like to play heavy games on mobile phone then battery not give full day backup, And it get discharge soon. Generally, battery give impressive backup.   \nPros   \n1. Display 4.5 inches with IPS. \n2. Touch response is very responsiveness. It have 5 fingers multi touch support. \n3. Overall Sound quality is incredible. \n4. Quad core processor with 1.2 GHz. \n5. Build in 3G, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. \n6. GPU : PowerVR SGX 544MP. ( Games played on this device like Subway Surfers, Temple Run Brave and Pocket Rally. These games were tested. And all these games run without any lag.) \n7. Camera : Rear 5 megapixel with Flash. Front 0.3 megapixel. \n8. 2000mAh Li - ion battery.   \nCons   \n1. It have only 512mb RAM. \n2. Camera for video recording is not Okay.   \nVerdict.   \nIt is clear that ZTE Blade G2 are perform theirs task very excellently. Mobile phone users almost get every feature on this mobile phone. So, What else expect with this device at 5K to 10K budget price. And at this budget price it is just unbelievable to grab a such kind of android mobile phone.   \nThanks,   \nRegards \nAmit Rawat    "], ["Dheena Indhran", "******Best phone ****** ", "\n ******Best phone ****** \n*i bought this a week before \n*performance is so Good \n*Battery backup \nI checked it by Full Changing and Draining it by \nUsing Continuous WiFi of more than 12 Hours \n,Voice call of 2 to 3 hours and Some normal usage the battery comes to 13% after \n22 hours of usage which i mentioned above \n*For Accessories such as Back cases Batteries, Flip Cover i think so you can Use Zte blade N881F(ebay) accessories because that are similar in products \n*A two times my phone got switched off in a day, i don't know why but other than that i found no issues "], ["Abhishek Kumar...", "ZTE Blade G2 V880H ", "\n Purchased ZTE mobile from Flipkart, received it the very next day of my order, \nAm really satisfied with this phone, Camera is very good, even in low light one can take good snaps, gameplay, sound, display, battery backup are very good.

The Pros and Cons are here -    \nPROS: \n1) The &quot;Scratch Resistant Dragon Trail Glass&quot; is really awesome. I have tested it with an unused shaving blade.  \n2) The Battery is truly a &quot;Made For The Long Run&quot;, i.e. :  \nAfter giving a full charge of 100%; I have Played 'Cut The Rope' for 1 hour, 3G surfing (Whats App, Facebook,Flipkart App &amp; Google Play Store) for 1 Hour and 40 Minutes, Listened Song (By Headphone) for 20 Minutes, Made 6 phone calls (Total 39.7 Minutes) &amp; typed 23 text messages...after doing all these things the battery indicator shows that there is 58% power left.  \n3) The Sound Quality is superb and seems like the 'Dolby Digital' sound of my laptop. \nThe Speaker and the Mic are also made of good quality.  \n4) The Display Quality is pretty as the color reproduction power is very good.  \n5) Led Flash is powerful enough.  \n6) Among the box accessories, the 'Headphone' and the 'Flip-cover' is of rich quality.  \n7) Very much Good Looking but a little bit heavy.  \n...&amp; Flipkart's decent packing quaity and perfect delivery time (4 days before the standard delivery date).  \nCONS: \n1) The Camera Quality is not at all like 8 Mega Pixel. It is, most probably, of 3.2 - 5.0 Megapixel.  \n2) I don't know why but when I play any high resolution game like Asphalt Airborne 8 or Temple run. for a long time; then the back side of my phone becomes very hot. In the specification of the phone LAVA says that the phone is powered by &quot;ARM Mali-400 MP2&quot; graphics. If the specification is really true, then why we, the customers, have to face this type of problems at the gaming time?  \n3) Among the box accessories, the 'Charger' is of very cheap quality.  \n...But still I would like to suggest that, within a budget of 8000/- , LAVA IRIS FUEL 50 is really unbeatably great for regular usage.  \n...THANK YOU.

As budget and basic the Desire C was it already wowed me back then. over the years I realise what I was using my phone the most for though : taking pictures.   \nSo based on this, I started researching and had more or less my mind set on the HTC Desire 820 before deciding for the M8 Eye.  \nThis was a case of an happy accident, as I decided to go to a store to buy the phone. There the 820 and the M8 eye were side by side, and the size and look of the M8 eye seemed more reasonable. My husband has the iPhone 6+ and he kept saying that as size goes, it is way too big for comfort. The Desire 820 was the same size which was its only negative point.    \nSo we did a quick research in the store, and tested both phones. The M8 eye was the clear winner. A tad smaller than the 820, a better screen resolution, a better look and feel, a body made of metal rather than all plastic and that amazing dual camera in the back that gives great depth and focus to you pictures.   \nSince the camera is what I was the most particular about, it mattered a lot. This one will not disappoint you. It gives very good quality pictures in daylight and well lit settings. Like all cameras that aren't DSLR it will give you less good result in low light. Though I must say that it seems to work better in low light than my 12MP point and shoot camera. For a phone, that is no small feat. \nOf all my camera device I would rate them in this order from lowest quality to highest : iPad 4, point and shoot Sony camera, HTC M8 Eye, and finally my Nikon DSLR.   \nRest of the phone specifics. I am not much of a music listener, so cant comment on the sound quality. I find it good so far. \nI was already used to HTC sense having had an HTC before, but this version is even more user friendly than the one I had on the Desire C.  \nThe phone works smoothly, no lags whatsoever and its screen size makes it very comfortable to browse online, which was a bit annoying to do on my previous phone.   \nThe size is perfect, not too big to be unfofortable to hold or carry and still big enough to give you a good reading experience on it.

The apps are even more fun because they are played on the big 5\u00e2\u0080\u009d IPS LCD display with True Colour technology which makes the display out put amazing and absolutely fit for the high resolution games. Another interesting fact about the Nokia XL is that I can download android apps on it from the Nokia App stores. These apps are now available on Nokia App store along with other third party apps stores. These apps can be downloaded for free. So I have downloaded many android apps from the stores along with a number of other smartphone apps like the HERE Maps, Nokia Mix Radio etc. I can also take pictures of really good quality in high resolutions with the 5MP camera. It also has a number of other editing features for editing the images that I click with it. Last but not the least it came with some offers such as the one month of free skype calls to landline and mobile phones.

Still Samsung is working on Lollipop to get stability of mobiles. Because signal strength issues , Battery drain issue &amp; heating issues can spoils everything. I got Lollipop out of the box. then i went to Samsung customer care and downgraded it to 4.2.2. and felt that device is working like a charm. then again updated through OTA to Lollipop. Samsung is providing lot of updates for stability &amp; thinks that it could help better. \nCamera is good.- It can facilitate video in slow motion mode too. Audio quality is also good.

I switched my wi-fi and got two updates over 4.4.2, performance and security related updates. First of all, I would like to say that there are many writing reviews for anything does not have real experience with that product at all. Just by analyzing statistics and online stuff, many, are writing reviews. One issue/review I was reading here said that the call sound is low. Actually, it the volume is really low but after consulting with a friend who is a Samsung Engineer, i learnt that the makers have tried to make this product biologically friendly as much as possible. Does that mean we have to strain our ears for listening lower volumes on call? The answer is no, there is a button in a 'connected' call screen which says enhance sound. Press it, and yes, now you get calls quite loud. So, basically, there are umpteenth features which are there in the phone but many people choose not to explore. For example, there is an excellent thought by the makers to address issues related to the big size of the phone and handling. So, by the use of a simple gesture, the phone screen can be made to go smaller, yes, you heard it right, the entire big screen display gets concentrated in a 4-inch display which can be aligned according to left or right hand. It's an immensely useful feature. Blazing fast processor and huge RAM makes running resource intensive apps a delight. Those who write about those make and that make, this core and that core, snapdragon or 'fire-breathing' dragon, admit it, human brains can't conceive those tiny ms lapses in the processor, if any. So, all those techno babble found on the net and shared likewise by some 'reviewers' are ultimately too hypocritic and loose. \n The Air gesture is superb, and so is the amazing amount of tasks that can be done by the s-pen. The get-up of the phone is great with narrow bezel and chrome edge, and looks premium. The battery backup is quite good. If someone says that the battery is bad, then surely they mismanage their phone. Another highlighting point is the camera, 13 mp, fine Xiaomi also gives that, but this phone's camera is great, the HDR is mindblowing and the aperture is also great. The night pictures were a revelation as people who have seen those pics of mine, agreed instantly that this is the best they have seen. Just for information, those friends all use phones of varied make and varied price from 10,000 and up..also, as i am a enthusiastic photographer, I myself use a good DSLR, no phone camera can give you a DSLR freedom and sensor, megapixels don't define a good picture quality, trust me. So, 5 mp can also be better than a 13 mp, but this have one of the best 'camera' in any phones of current Indian market .  "], ["darshan karekar", "worth the money...

Not able to try the hotknot feature.

For my usage its perfect, sometimes more than perfect. The LED panel is very useful. You can customize the Colours for specific type of notification. The Dual core Krait 300 1.7 Ghz processor is more than enough for everyday usage and proper gaming. It beats a Quad Core A7 1.2 Ghz in performance(MOTO G &amp; LG L90 and most of the phones that come in this range). Other phones that come in this range have Adreno 305 as the GPU, but this has Adreno 320, 20 times faster GPU. It gives way better performance in games than those phones.   \nDon't worry Xiaomi is not a compitition as it doesn't have enough service centres in India and has the Worst possible After Sales I've ever dealt with.   \nThis phone Out of the Box comes with Jelly Bean 4.1, You can update the phone till Jelly Bean 4.3. No further Updates :( I dont care about it though. I have everything i need. I recommend you to stay in 4.1 because it has better Stamina Mode (Battery saver mode on Xperia Phones) than any other Xperia Smartphones. Once I went from 100% to 12% in 5 Days, with 7hrs of Screen On Time. How you use the battery solely depends on how you use the phone. Streaming videos till your eyes pop out will give you a 5 to 6 hrs of battery life max, which is average battery life when you use your phone like this.   \nI didn't have any heating issues while gaming. All latest games ran flawless(except the buggy games). I've tried N.O.V.A. 3 Believe me it runs with Subway Surfers like smoothness. The gyroscope in Modern Combat 4 won't work, because the game has problems. You can go to xdadevelopers to get a list of games that run flawless on this phone.   \nThis phone is made up of Aluminium body. The temperature around you will affect the temperature of the phone. Without even turning on the phone's Aluminium frame will absorb the temperature. If you're in a cold climate your phone will become a portable ice pack. But if you're in a hotter climate the frame will become hot. I suggest you keep the phone covered in a phone case or pouch in this type of situation. Although this doesn't affect the phone's internal temperature.   \nThis phone is not waterproof and it has gorilla glass 1st gen. Use the screen carefully or you'll get smudges and ocassionally your fingers will stick to the screen and won't slide across it like gorilla glass 3. But this problem also occurs sometimes in gorilla glass 3.   \nDon't drop your phone. The results are inconclusive, in some cases it breaks. In some cases it is Iron Man. And in some cases the frame will loose its silver glow. There is a guide in xdadevelopers if that happens.Although fingers crossed.   \nOne thing about Android version 4.1 and 4.3 is Adobe Flash Player works flawlessly. That right you can play computer flash games on your phone. Adobe discarded flash player development for Android platform after the release of 4.4 kitkat because of huge memory leaks and CPU usage hence making battery drain unbearable. So you can sideload flash player apk to your phone and play flash games.   \nIf you have a Dualshock 3 controller you can use it to play games on your phone via bluetooth. Screen mirroring is possible both via WiFi and MHL cable to TV. \nYou can use your phone as a Portable Gaming Platform. Connect your phone to TV via MHL to HDMI cable, then use Dualshock 3 to play games. Just Like PS3. "], ["Prashant Chauhan", "Waste of money..

But it's better than other micromax devices of this range &amp; moto g.   \n2. DISPLAY is HD, true HD! Other than the micromax brand, as thought to be of poor quality, it has all features &amp; looks of premium phones.   \n3. Rear CAMERA is of 8Megapixel. It is really very good. Images taken in good light will give you enough reasons to become a photographer using this phone.   \n4. Gaming! This phone NEVER HANGES OR LAGS. I have been playing world of tanks blitz on this phone which actually suggests iphone 6! Such a great replacement for iphone 6 at such a low price.    \n5. It's SPEAKER is good. Let it be for music or calling or loudspeaker calls.   \n6. BREAKAGE of any kind seems impossible regarding this phone. It has fallen on ground several times but it works the same way as before.    \n7. SIM ports are two which support full size or original size sim.   \n8. NAVIGATION works really well. Some people complaint about it's GPS functioning, but there's no such problem with it.   \n9. You can expand the memory &amp; moving apps from phone memory to SD card through phone's file manager is really very convinent.   \nCons - \n1. Headphones are cheap.   \n2. FRONT CAMERA sucks. It clicks pictures with too much of noise. ( noise = particle thingy in photos ).   \n3. While clicking photos, tapping on screen WON'T CLICK PICTURES. You need to click on icon specifically for clicking pictures. It makes harder to click selfies with rear camera. Although with apps like CandyCam, Retrica problems can be solved.    \n4. Inbuilt memory space is really very less. You will NEED TO EXPAND MEMROY WITH A MEMORY CARD.   \nOverall my experience with this phone has been awesome.

And, in case you find a problem with phone, it's gonna take forever to get corrected those from customer care of flipkart/seller. Overall it's really very good phone. Based on my experience i review it this way- \nPros -   \n1. Like every other smartphone it's BATTERY dies after 8-9 hours of continuous usage. But it's better than other micromax devices of this range &amp; moto g.   \n2. DISPLAY is HD, true HD! Other than the micromax brand, as thought to be of poor quality, it has all features &amp; looks of premium phones.   \n3. Rear CAMERA is of 8Megapixel. It is really very good. Images taken in good light will give you enough reasons to become a photographer using this phone.   \n4. Gaming! This phone NEVER HANGES OR LAGS. I have been playing world of tanks blitz on this phone which actually suggests iphone 6! Such a great replacement for iphone 6 at such a low price.    \n5. It's SPEAKER is good. Let it be for music or calling or loudspeaker calls.   \n6. BREAKAGE of any kind seems impossible regarding this phone. It has fallen on ground several times but it works the same way as before.    \n7. SIM ports are two which support full size or original size sim.   \n8. NAVIGATION works really well. Some people complaint about it's GPS functioning, but there's no such problem with it.   \n9. You can expand the memory &amp; moving apps from phone memory to SD card through phone's file manager is really very convinent.   \nCons - \n1. Headphones are cheap.   \n2. FRONT CAMERA sucks. It clicks pictures with too much of noise. ( noise = particle thingy in photos ).   \n3. While clicking photos, tapping on screen WON'T CLICK PICTURES. You need to click on icon specifically for clicking pictures. It makes harder to click selfies with rear camera. Although with apps like CandyCam, Retrica problems can be solved.    \n4. Inbuilt memory space is really very less. You will NEED TO EXPAND MEMROY WITH A MEMORY CARD.   \nOverall my experience with this phone has been awesome.

Surprisingly still service forms are providing site address to check the status. Like Ticket number but we have to assume Barcode will be ticket then enter in site. \n- Service center peoples as usual rash manner. Manager Naveen is ok in Jayanagar. Service centers will work only for who will quarrel with them .If you are not having BP, you will get once you visited. \n- If 100 customers are coming minimum 90 people are quarreling with staff. Even lady customers also have been quarrelling with the customer care people. \n- No one will call you even after they diagnosed the problem what is the problem and how many days will it take to repair. At the same even you called also they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pick the call hahhahaha what a great service? \n- Finally I felt that these are basic checks would have checked by HTC Management before allow vendors opened the Authorized service centers. If HTC Management would have commitment on customer service obvious TVSE and other vendors would have been followed it. These would have checked by HTC initially customer service is not like this. \n- HTC need only business from customer not their satisfaction. If they would have intention to provide best services to customers, would have taken care these basic things by doing regular supervising the Service centers and change environment in the Service centers. \nEven if you serviced outside consider basic repair shop, usually he will call u once after the completion and at the same time pick the call on enquiry about the repair status. \nFinally I came to conclusion that I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prefer HTC in future as its delicate phones obviously we may expect repairs will be more compared to Nokia and Apple.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not made from metal and sits in the middle of HTC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smartphone portfolio. However, its two-tone plastic finish is far from ugly and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solid and easy to grip. I found the finish to be less tacky than the Galaxy S5 and Note 4. \nThe most peculiar thing about the Desire Eye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance is its large front-facing camera.   \nSurprisingly, though, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t distracting and works well. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also nice is the fact that the phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speakers have been placed cleanly at either end of its display. At first glance, it would seem there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any at all. But there are, if you look carefully.   \nDisplay : \nThe Desire Eye comes packed with a 5.2-inch (1080 x 1920 pixels) display, with a density of 424 pixels per inch (PPI). This is virtually the same as HTC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flagship One M8, though that manages a slightly higher pixel density of 441 PPI.   \nColors are sharp and wide-ranged, with darks, in particular, standing out. Like the majority of smartphones, though, colors aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as clear when exposed to daylight. However, this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a major issue, and you can still enjoy your favorite shows and movies while on the go.   \nSoftware : \nThe Desire Eye runs Android KitKat with HTC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sense 6 UI atop. Sense has to be one of the simplest Android UIs out there, unlike Samsung\u00e2\u0080\u0099s TouchWiz, which is cluttered with superfluous animations and functions. Here, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sense of fluency that makes it easy to use and good to look at.   \nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s particularly useful is the BlinkFeed function. Situated on the phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homescreen, it provides you with a list of content you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from newspaper reports to social media updates.   \nAnother nifty feature is HTC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Do Not Disturb Mode, which lets you disable notifications at certain times of the day. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an iOS user, you may have noticed that this is the same name as Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s variant. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both good and get the job done.   \nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full access to the Google Play Store, too, as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect.   \nPerformance : \nSporting a quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor, the Desire Eye is well-equipped. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not up to the standard of the Snapdragon 805, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still powerful enough to provide you with a smooth performance and can handle demanding games like Asphalt 8. \nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage on offer, which can be expanded with an additional up to 128GB via the microSD card slot.   \nThe Desire Eye offers up a 2,400mAh battery, which is smaller than the M8\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by just 200mAh. According to HTC, it has 20 hours of talk time and can last up to 538 hours on stand-by.   \nCamera : \nThe Desire Eye has two 13-megapixel cameras \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one on the front and one on the back. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a dual-LED flash on the front, which means you get to take selfies in the day as well as at night. The only thing different with the front-facer is that it has a smaller aperture. \nThanks to a dedicated shutter button, you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a problem taking photos, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fast shutter speed. You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be disappointed with the overall quality, either, as photos look sharp and colorful. What is worth noting, however, is that images taken in the dark lack detail slightly, and the dual-LED can make photos look washed out. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a problem you get with the iPhone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dual-LED rear flash, but there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a flash on the front.   \nVerdict : \nThis is one of the most selfie-obsessed smartphones out there, so if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re vain, you needn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look any further.   \nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not into your selfies, you may find it inconvenient to have a huge front-facing camera slapped in front of you. That said, the Desire Eye is certainly capable as an all-rounder, with an elegant and strong design, a fast processor and a battery that can get you through the day.

After using Nokia. BlackBerry. iPhone. Sony Experia. Samsung and Motorola. I came to discover dis Xolo Q1200 a venture of lava. I bought from Flipkart with a decent delivery. I bought it for its nice look and of course Gorilla glass-3 to be frank. Wanted to give a try on China mobile. This is my only biggest mistake. Becoz, it took me only a day to hate this mobile.    \nMy honest verdict :- \nBATTERY: one of the poorest. even without 2G usage, the battery discharges one by one point as soon as you ON the mobile. Reason behind it is that the stupidity done by the engineer/developer to give it a high resolution of 1080p without making the battery compatible to it. Hence fooling Indians. This not happens in case of branded mobiles.  \nCAMERA : Average. night mode also average. but when you take video it is showing 1080p 3gpp quality not a MP4 dis may be a drawback for some.  \nSOUND : it is mentioned in the box as DTS but nothing like that when you listen to bass oriented club edit DJ songs you will be frustrated with quality of sound it reaches your ear like some 3rd rated crap sound. Huff Pathetic! Sound quality good ONLY for Ghazal and romantic/silent songs only. \nGAMING / 3G USE: When use 3G or play Hi-end games it plays all but the mobile Gets Heated like burning sensation sort at the back panel. \nPROCESSOR / OS : Good clock speed no issue. and operating system is jelly bean upgradable to kit kat so no issue. My Bottom line is Xolo Q1200 is good in many aspects but poor in battery level. There is nothing to blame Flipkart for this. I am buying products from Flipkart since 3 years.... but first time I bought a China set like Xolo. Believe it or not it took 23% of battery discharge in typing this review in a XOLO notepad. Sony or Samsung would have taken only 2 or 3% of battery only.  \nMy suggest don't your hard earned money...on this stuff.

", "\n I got this phone for my dad, and after seeing it in use for a week, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by it. The build quality is excellent - the kind I would have expected from my usual HTCs. The glass in front, the metal-build on the sides and the tight faux-leather finish give it a very premium look and feel, much like the Samsung Note 2, and no exaggeration there! Call quality is good, cameras are decent both on the front and back (no HD video recording though - just a measly 854x480), and viewing angles are very good. In the outdoors, the screen isn't the best out there, but it does just fine! In short, it gives you almost all the features of the Moto G at 3k less!! (And yes, it doesn't have a gorilla glass screen, so be careful not to knock it around. As a consolation, I have several friends who've broken their gorilla glass screens on phone sizes 5'' or above. Not to mention that the optics of the best phones get damaged with any number of drops. So bottomline, regardless of any phone, don't drop it!)   \nAs for Windows Phone 8.1, I find little to blame in it. Each OS has its short-comings - Android many more than others (something most people don't know or refuse to believe) with the viruses, the unnecessary access to personal data for all random apps, and constant lagging, even on the most powerful phones such as the S4 and the HTC One Max. WP is clean and quick. Much neater and the OS never hangs. And I find every single app of my choice available - Adobe Photoshop Express, Adobe Reader, Authenticator, Axis Bank, Cocktail Flow, Dictionary.com. Despicable Me : Minion Rush, Files, HDFC bank, HERE Drive+, HERE Maps, Hungry Shark Evolution, Indian Express, IndiGo, Mixology, Runtastic apps, Skype, State Bank Freedom, Sticky Notes HD., NYT Crossword, Truecaller, Viber, Whatsapp, Wikipedia, and many more. The app gap thing is mostly an over-exaggeration - Android will have almost a 1000 flashlight softwares to WP's say 50, so there is bound to be a difference in number, but most, if not all the useful apps are there. Won't find any trouble on that front.   \nThe Snapdragon 200 does disappoint a bit - but then again, coupled with a 1 GB RAM, it pulls through just fine, and what else could one ask for a sub-10k phone! Multi-tasking is quick, and games such as Asphalt 8 : Airborne play without any lag, and at a smooth frame-rate!   \nSanjay Kavade wrote in his review certain things which I wish to clear -  \n1. &quot;According to official Microsoft web Windows 8.1 has folder creation on tiles but you can not create it in W121 though it is Windows 8.1.&quot; - That is a feature of WP 8.1 Update 1, which can be gotten for now through a Preview for Developers or will be released in the near future. \n2. &quot;You can't play ringtone while you setting it. You have to make a call to see what kind of ringtone you have set.&quot; - In the list of ringtones there is a play button in a circle on the left side on the screen, upon touching which you get a preview of the ringtone. \n3. &quot;Ringtone volume adjustment is not good. You can not have individual volume control for system volume, Alarm volume, massage volume, phone ring volume&quot; - You have 2 different sets of volume controls - Ringer &amp; Notifications, and Media &amp; Apps.  \n4. &quot;Internet Data toggle is not available on notification bar. you have always go to setting to turn it on and off.&quot; - That is true, although MS promised to remedy that in the upcoming updates. For the time being, one can download Cellular Data by Microsoft Corporation and pin that to the start screen to toggle phone data.    \nIn all fairness, this is a brilliant phone! You may lack the Nokia/Microsoft Mobile apps but you get all the rest. Its a great device, and I recommend this to anyone who wishes to spend around 10k for a phone!   \nGreat device, and servicing seems promising. No wonder Micromax is as of this financial quarter the leading smartphone seller in India, having overtaken even the giant Samsung!

All the windows 8.1 features are running very well. Battery backup is not as good as 2000mAh has to be. It lasts for 7-8 hours. If you connect to the internet it will last for 4-5 hours with continuous usage. One thing that I should mention the network connectivity is superb and I never felt any network issues. Rear Camera quality is average and not like 8 MP. The front camera is so much disappointing since it cannot take clear pictures in low light, even you will feel very irritating if you go for video chat in artificial light. Display resolution is good to play all HD videos. \nThe huge drawback which is usually expected from Micromax is the average hardware. Speaker quality is so average and if you play audio over speaker it will make you a little disappointing.

I must say that i was quite amazed after using the phone. I didn't expect so muxh at Rs 8051. The camera is the best part, it is even better than q1010i. The only phone that is comparable at this price range is huawei honor holly which is also a very good phone and Rs.1000 less. I have bought one from flipkart for my friend. Why i bought xolo omega instead is that xolo phones have a good 1-2 day battery backup depending upon use. Also it will get lollipop update and i have a good xolo service center available in Srinagar. I also dont like the huawei user interface which is like miui but that is a matter of personal taste. So the best phones in under 10k rande is xolo omega or huawei holly. I have now stopped using the htc's, samsung's, sony's etc because practically speaking all the work you need to do with your phone can be effectively done with these chinese branded phones also. Quad core or octa core, mtk or krait processor, 1.3 quad core mtk or 2.2 quad core krait are just therotical marketing gimmicks for the common man. Trust me it make very little effect on the practical performance while using the phone for normal activities. A common man uses the phone for calling, accessing internet, reading books, taking photos/videos, using whatsapp /viber/skype etc. All these functions are flawlessly done by phones like xolo omega &amp; huawei holly. I is just the brand name that is better with the samsung's and htc's. So a wise man will not waste his hard earned money. Some say that these food brand phones last longer with less issues. Let me tell you that problems arise in every electronic device whether branded or not. Only the issues of branded ones are not highlighted as they already have a well built reputation. On the other hand the issues of the brands like xolo, micromax gain much attention. Xolo has the worst customer service reputation but my experience with xolo care was the best. My 8 month old xolo q900 was getting repeatedly hanged. Xolo people provided me a brand new q1010i (much better than q900) as a replacement for with free of cost and even called me for confirmation. What else do you want.  \n Coming back to the phone, xolo omega 5 has all that is required for daily use:- 5' HD screen, octa core processor, 1GB ram (plenty of free ram available, good ram management), MaliMP4 600Mhz processor (for those who want to waste their precious time in gaming), very good front and back camera, good battery backup and all that for Rs 8051 only. 5 stars.... "], ["das", "Not Bad for the Price. ", "\n Got the Phone three days before the delivery date. Wasn't surprised. Now about the phone.Now that we generally replace phones more frequently than we replace your jeans, the novelty of a new phone doesn't last that long. This phone?? It feels good in your hands. Move over Samsungs and Nokias. Given the price range (8051/-), I don't think there are any of&quot;&quot;reputed&quot; brands offer the listed features, and build quality. The finish of the phone is excellent. Glossy black finish, with the metal band across makes it look sleek. However the phone isn't the sleekest around, but the metal strip around makes it look sleek. The octa core doesn't disappoint either. Its fast, lagging and the hive UI isn't bad either. It takes time for you to get used to the UI, but then you can modify it to suit your needs. The phone does attract a lot of fingerprint, no matter how clean and dry your hands are.The phone lasts roughly around two days with a single charge, being on for 24 hrs with 2g and wifii on. But then I dont' fidget with phone every 2 mins. Special mention about the phones weight. I have been using a samsung S duos 2 earlier, compared to the Omega, the S duos feels like a shell. Seriously, if you are being attacked, just throw the damn phone at your attacker's head. I am sure it will knock him /(her) out. The weight might be a negative for some people, but for me it just heavy enough for the phone to be seated firmly on my palm. Considering the glossy finish a lighter phone would easily go for a occasional toss. "]], "title": "XOLO Omega 5.0"}

IN OTHER ASPECTS GOOD MOBILE "], ["Ankit Fadia", "Impressive ", "\n I got the Lava Magnum a month or so ago and after using it for that long a period, I think I can finally write a proper review about my experience.   \nDesign and build \nThe Lava Magnum looks a lot like the current crop of lava phones like the pro 30 and the X1, but that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a bad thing. It looks very premium and the metallic touches on the side really add a classy look to the phone. When holding the phablet for the first time, I was actually quite surprised by how light the Magnum is. However, the build quality is also quite impressive as my little nephew uses it and he has dropped it multiple times and also used it with his sticky and gooey hands at it still runs fine.   \nPerformance \nThe Magnum comes with a 1.2 GHz quad core processor as well as 1 GB of RAM to run the Google 4.4.2 Kitkat OS smoothly. This version of OS is already designed to work on lower powered devices with dual core processors and half the RAM so using the phablet is a blast. Gaming is quite fun and playing games like Candy Crush and Clash of Clans and FIFA 14 run without many problems.    \nStorage \nThe phablet comes with 8 GB of internal memory out of which about 6 Gb was available to the user. Thankfully, you can always put a micro SD card in the phablet. I have but a 16 GB card and there hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been any lag in the device as of now.   \nCamera  \nThe primary camera module of the phone is an 8 mp unit with a BSI sensor for improved low light performance. The images are pretty good but I feel that the images taken at light are a little too washed out for my taste. Images taken during the day are very good and the focusing speed is quite impressive as well. The front facing camera is a 2 mp unit and this is the first device where I have actively used the front facing camera. The image is pretty sharp and you will find yourself taking a whole lot of selfies with the Magnum.   \nDisplay and multimedia \nThe phone comes with a large 6 inch HD screen with a resolution of 245 ppi. The images are quite crisp and viewing angles are good. The speaker quality is also quite nice and clear. While the headphones provided with the phablet are pretty decent, buy a better pair of headphones to truly enjoy your experience. The phablet supports a variety of multimedia formats including 1080p video playback.   \nConclusion \nThe Lava Magnum X604 is a very impressive phablet what I am very happy to own despite the protests from a bunch of my friends. The phone not only looks impressive, but the performance is quite impressive as well. Definitely the best gadget I own right now!     "]], "title": "Lava Magnum X604"}

Overall display is a visual treat for watching hd videos. \n2.Boomsound speakers \nArguably the best front firing speakers for smartphones.The sound quality is audible and clear enough than other competitors. \n3.Xelio X10 processor \nSome may be concerned about going for a mediatek, initially i too had that in mind. When you use the device you can feel that you are wrong.It can match with equivalent snapdragon processors.There is no lags or slowdown so far. The eight cores does a good job when it come to multitasking. The gpu should have been improved but it does not reflect on performance though..I was able to play Real racing 3, FIFA 15, Dead Trigger 2 without any lags. \nIn benchmarking it gives a 49736 for antutu, 60.3fps in Nenamark2 and Geekbench3 multi core score of 4507. \nPlus on a positive note, continuous benchmark tests shows that the mediatek maintaned stable performance while Qualcomm tend to decrease in performance due to thermal effect. \n3. Camera \nA 20mp back camera covered with a sapphire glass. The camera is very fast in clicking and the detail of the picture also good. For those who know how to change aperture, iso,shutter speed there is a full manual control available.The htc M9+ can save in raw format but that camera upadate may be available soon for e9+ too. \nBokeh mode, slow motion video capture and a bunch of camera option available to play with. Another major feature is that it can shoot 4k videos which is now getting to all top end smartphones.but full hd will do fine as of now.The fhd video quality is good. \nAnother feature is the low light capable ultrapixel camera. As htc advertise it performs pretty well under low lit conditions. \n4.Software \nE9+ ships with android 5.0.2 out of the box and htc sense 7 ui. The blend of these two is very carefully done and it gives the user a smoother and personalized user interface. \n5.Design and form factor \nThe device is well built and looks premium. It feels very light in hand you might want to add a back cover or dot case(which i didn't got so far) for extra grip and protection..The phone is bit taller and one handed use may feel uncomfortable at times but i hope you will get used to it soon. \n6.Battery \nThe device packs a 2800mah non removable battery which provides enough juice to take to a full day with moderate usage.If you are a heavy user you may need to opt for power saving mode or extreme power saving mode at the end of the day.On a full charge in the morning i was able to get 25% left at night aftr using with airtel 4G all day, whatsapp, facebook, image editing, A full length 2hr movie, songs. \nSo the battery is ok as far as the specs are concerned.htc software paired with Android does a good job in keeping the phone running efficiently. \nOverall verdict: \nIts a premium looking smartphone with killer specs.

Here is my take, comparing mainly with S6 or Iphone 6:   \nCons: \n1) Camera is 20 megapixel but certainly not as great in low light or inside as it has been claimed. With all possible settings pictures are not as sharp and great.  \n2) Lots of sensors that even S4 had have not found place here. Gives you a slightly climb down feeling. \n3) In-call audio is definitely less crispy and clear. \n4) Phone calls are audible only if the left end of the phone is on your ear. \n5) Stereo speakers are good, but no equaliser or audio quality settings. I downloaded audio apps. \n6) It takes painfully long to charge. Though initial 255 are quite fast. \n7) Some basic touch sensor gestures and motions to send texts and make calls in S4 are also missing here! \n8) The screen area could have been easily increased. \n9) The battery is not replacable.   \nPros: \n1) Despite all these cons I am not unhappy with the buy. Certainly feels an upgrade over S4 on many counts. \n2) Battery life is much better than Samsung. \n3) The price is pretty good! After SBI card discount offer in the flipkart app it cost Rs 33.5k. Not bad for a nice big screen.   \nBuying here? \n1) Flipkart has a WRONG description/specs of the phone. This phone has two sim card slots, not one as claimed in the specs here. \n2) Tracking of order was very nicely updated on the app and was pretty cool! \n3) Delivery time? Flipkart was pretty good with generally 48 hrs delivery. But was given a deadline of 10 odd days. Though it landed after 6 days. \n4) It surely could have been faster.   \nIf you are clear that you want to save money and still want a pretty good deal, go for it.

Here are my own examples- \nDay 1:- Received in the evening a 5 PM and when opened, the battery was 58 %. I switched on the phone, configured it with Wi-Fi and used continuously up to 10 PM via Wi-Fi only downloading the apps, doing personalization and transferring all the things from old phone and the battery left at 10 PM was 21 %. \nDay-2:- Fully charged previous night and the battery remaining in the morning was 89 % then I started the day again at 8 AM with the same curiosity things on a new phone and kept 3G on permanently for whole day and using Whatsapp, Facebook, net surfing and at the end of the day at 5 PM, the battery remaining was 39% which lasted for whole night and needed charging in the morning. \nDay-3:- started with 100 % battery at 7 AM and installed about 100 apps and configured all of them, watched videos, taken pictures, whatsapp was permanently on and 3G was also permanently on. Made my own themes and did various things not allowing the screen to be off even for a second i.e. used it continuously for 5 hours doing all the things and screen was kept open for 5 hours continuously without a blink of screen. Any other phone would have begged for charging and would have heated up to boiling point but this one left with 27 % battery and cool like was kept in AC. All these things were apart from the calls I received and dialed which is average 40 calls before noon and 40 after noon. \nP.S. :- If you switch off data connection, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wonder from where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operating i.e. battery is almost not at all used. \nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think anyone would require more rigorous use of phone than this. So you can be sure of battery lasting the day long irrespective of your field.  \nThe features don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be told as are already mentioned. Yes corrections are as below- \n1. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dual SIM phone not a single SIM \n2. SD card support is up to 2 TB and not only 128 GB \n3. The weight of the phone is 135 gm and not 150 gm \nAll these features are not available even on high budget phones up to 55 K so you should grab it for sure. \nCons:- \n1. The phone is large in size and its because the bezel is much more. The size can be reduced by almost an Inch if HTC would have designed it precisely. \n2. User Interface is not as much appealing as is in Samsung premium phones and LG premium phones. I was using LG G2 and I will still declare it a winner over E9+ on inner appearance of the phone. \n3. HTC is giving a charger with 1 AMP adapter which will require about 2 and half hours to charge the phone to full. They should have given at least 2 AMP so that charging time could have been reduced to half. \nOverall it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a treat on 35 K. You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get such features in this budget and that too from a renowned company like HTC. So don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think, just go for it.

First of all let me share my experience with this phone.    \nAs far as the built quality is concerned, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just awesome. in last one year i accidently dropped my phone almost 10 times sometimes from table sometimes from my bike. Never seen any single crack sign or performance degradation ever not even a scratch.   \nScreen is just awesome. And the most important gift it's camera. The 20.7 MP camera is just amazing. One can straightaway compare the picture quality with any of the DSLR. Thanks to Sony's dedicated camera app.   \nNow the most important point. The performance. Before lollypop update it was one of the best ,BUT after the Lollypop update i can say it's average. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why Sony is forcing this device with a new update even though it's not designed to take all of them. After the L update, i an noticing considerable lag , mostly while playing games if you want to switch to the home screen, everything goes blank not even a single icon is visible. This will persist for more than 10 seconds and suddenly everything will be normal again. I can bet this was not the case for KitKat because i have used this phone with KitKat from last 8-9 months and never saw this lag. Sony needs to work in this. \nThe music and sound quality is best as always with Sony. Thanks to clear audio that now you can listen your favorite songs with ultra-clear sound .

Much better than Samsung phones \nCamera :- One of the best i've seen so far. I have almost stopped using DSLRs for my short trips. \nRAM :- 2 GB RAM, at any given point of time at least 500-600 MB is available. so fairly good. Sometimes, i've seen the phone go slow while playing a few high resource consuming games. but very good overall performance \nForm Factor: its very comfortable to hold. Perfect size.Not too large, not too small. \nWater resistant : Yes it is. no problem in rain or elsewhere. \nSound : Excellent quality. WhatsApp/Viber or Normal calls, or songs.   \nCons: \n1. Heating :- Sometimes the phone gets heated. I've seen temperatures of 46 Celcius sometimes. It happens with resource hungry games &amp; even charging. it is kind of expected but when phone gets heated up, the touch screen acts funny and there's no option but to either wait for it to cool or restart. \n2. Charging flap :- The phone is waterproof, but that is mainly because of the flaps provided as covers. the problem is since the phone is being everyday by opening the charging flaps, the flaps do tend to break. At least mine did once. had to replace it (inexpensive but it happens)   \nOverall a very nice phone. Phone does tend to be slow as memory shrinks.

In this review, I am not going to tell the specs of these smartphone, since you all aware of it. \nFirst of all, thanks to Flipkart for delivering my product within the estimated time of delivery. \nComing to the product,  \nIt was an awesome XPERIENCE while using my XPERIA Z2. I have already used HTC desire S for the past 3 years and I have gone many research about smartphones before buying it. Since I am a hardcore user, this smartphone suits me a lot. I have listed some important things which will be helpful for those people who wish to buy XPERIA Z2. \n1) HIGH END GAMES runs smooth with no lag, but while playing any games there is a bit lag at the beginning. But after few seconds it becomes lag free. I have played ASPHALT 8, DEAD TRIGGER, MODERN KOMBAT X. All these games works fine. \n2) USER INTERFACE is buttery smooth and works fine. New and popular eye catchy theme launchers are available which will make your xperia more colorful. \n3) coming to the CAMERA performance, many camera features are added in this smartphone like background defocus, AR effect,creative effect,time shift burst, sweep panorama, Last but not the least, it can record ULTRA HD videos (i.e) 4K videos with Rear facing camera which is 20.7 MP :-O I have also took selfies and videos UNDERWATER. Those pics and videos are excellent.  \nwhile coming to the Front facing camera, I am bit disappointed with its clarity. i noticed Some pixelations while viewing through it. Again, it may be rectified by making a system update. \n4)BUILD QUALITY is brilliant. i have accidentally dropped on the concrete floor 3 times. but it works fine. And the important thing is that i have tested it underwater since it is a water resistant phone.  \n5) DISPLAY the display of this xperia z2 is seems to be quiet brilliant since it has full HD resolution. It also has the feature of x-reality engine which make the picture and videos look vibrant and sharp. I enjoyed very much while watching videos and playing games. \n6) SOUND : the sound clarity from the speaker is good but not excellent. But the headphone sound output is marvelous. while i heard songs through the headset i became speechless. :-*  \n7) CALL CLARITY : call clarity is good enough and noise cancellation microphone works fine. The only problem is that Sony provided in-the ear headphone but it is not a noise cancellation ear phones. The other person in the call and myself noticed some kind of noises when I touch or rub my microphone. Even the headsets with low price range does not have this problem. \n8) BATTERY. I have to admit truly. The battery backup is Damn good. with normal usage you would get 1 and 1/2 days and with heavy usage with internet, gaming etc you would get 1 day.Using stamina mode, low battery mode you can save the last juice of the battery. Hats off to 3200mAh battery.  \nFinally, my ratings are \nGAMING 9/10 \nUI 9/10 \nCAMERA 8/10 \nDISPLAY 10/10 \nSOUND 8/10 \nCALL CLARITY 8/10 \nBATTERY 9/10. \nIf you are plannning to buy this gadget, Blindly go for it.  \nThank you :-)    "], ["Syam S Nair", "SUPERBB PRODUCT ", "\n amazing mobile , good battery back up ,camera , walkman aplication is superbbb , \nover all nice product , thanks sony , iam used in 3g , games , batery is not heated "], ["ShrungaRaj Chi...", "IM NOT SURE IF IVE RECEIVED A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT ", "\n IN THE TWO DAYS OF USAGE, THE SIM FLAP CAME OUT AND AFTER A FEW DAYS THE MEMORY SLOT TOO.

Lollipop update is also supposed to come by December end, as Samsung is already updating S5 in certain market now. So, no issues here.  \nAs my gf uses iPhone 6+, I have been able to use it for a couple of days and a comparison with it is inevitable. In lot of aspects the comparison holds true for the regular iPhone 6 also.  \niPhone6+ though a very popular phone and also falls in the same price bracket, but, thats where the similarities end.  \niPhone6+ feels more bulky and slippery in hand with its larger dimensions, due to larger bezels, even though it has a smaller screen size!! Otherwise, the build quality is very good, even tough many people have reported that because of softer/thinner metal used in iPhone, it may bend in your pocket if subjected to certain pressure.  \nios on iPhone feels very good &amp; fluid, but not as powerful as the TouchWiz which has tons of multitasking features.  \nThere are also many advantages of using Note4 over iPhone, because of many restrictions in iPhone ios when compared to Android/TouchWiz. For example, Call Recording feature is just not possible on iPhone, but works great on the Note4. There is also no notification led light on iPhone, which feels pretty frustrating.   \nWith a paltry 1GB of ram iPhone is just no match to the Note4 when it comes to multi-tasking, with 3GB ram and the wonderful SPen  \nThe display on the Note4 is also much better.    \nI did not like that Samsung has that Samsung has released Snapdragon in India because till the time Snapdragon was better we used to get Exynos, and when this time around Exynos has out-performed Snapdragon and is 64 bit future ready chip, we get 'inferior' Snapdragon.    \nWe want EXYNOS NOTE 4 WITH 4G HERE.   \nBottom line - The Note4 is truly the BEST smartphone your money can buy at present, in comparison iPhone just feels like a smart feature phone from an iconic and overtly expensive brand.

The exynos version is sold in select markets like Korea. But it's unclear from the provided specs whether the model sold in flipkart is that one or the one with the Snapdragon 805.   \nBut if it is the Exynos 5433, it's not the &quot;crap&quot; as most believe it to be. In fact it shows higher benchmark scores than the Snapdragon 805 most likely due to the use of 64 bit ARMv8 architecture while Snapdragon is still stuck with v7 arch. the exynos is second only to the nVidia Tegra K1, while the 805 falls behind at the 3rd place. (Lately they are surpassed by Apple A8 and nvidia denver by a large margin though)   \nSo whether it is the exynos or the snapdragon both are excellent processors. The reason samsung is not advertising the exynos much is likely not to disappoint the US customers who are getting a lesser version with the 805 while select Asian markets are enjoying the better exynos one.   \nI think Flipkart and the associated sellers are not being honest here by putting unclear specifications.   \nIf it is listed as 2.7GHz Quad, it's Snapdragon 805, and if 1.9/1.3GHz Octa, it's exynos.

IN OTHER ASPECTS GOOD MOBILE "], ["Ankit Fadia", "Impressive ", "\n I got the Lava Magnum a month or so ago and after using it for that long a period, I think I can finally write a proper review about my experience.   \nDesign and build \nThe Lava Magnum looks a lot like the current crop of lava phones like the pro 30 and the X1, but that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a bad thing. It looks very premium and the metallic touches on the side really add a classy look to the phone. When holding the phablet for the first time, I was actually quite surprised by how light the Magnum is. However, the build quality is also quite impressive as my little nephew uses it and he has dropped it multiple times and also used it with his sticky and gooey hands at it still runs fine.   \nPerformance \nThe Magnum comes with a 1.2 GHz quad core processor as well as 1 GB of RAM to run the Google 4.4.2 Kitkat OS smoothly. This version of OS is already designed to work on lower powered devices with dual core processors and half the RAM so using the phablet is a blast. Gaming is quite fun and playing games like Candy Crush and Clash of Clans and FIFA 14 run without many problems.    \nStorage \nThe phablet comes with 8 GB of internal memory out of which about 6 Gb was available to the user. Thankfully, you can always put a micro SD card in the phablet. I have but a 16 GB card and there hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been any lag in the device as of now.   \nCamera  \nThe primary camera module of the phone is an 8 mp unit with a BSI sensor for improved low light performance. The images are pretty good but I feel that the images taken at light are a little too washed out for my taste. Images taken during the day are very good and the focusing speed is quite impressive as well. The front facing camera is a 2 mp unit and this is the first device where I have actively used the front facing camera. The image is pretty sharp and you will find yourself taking a whole lot of selfies with the Magnum.   \nDisplay and multimedia \nThe phone comes with a large 6 inch HD screen with a resolution of 245 ppi. The images are quite crisp and viewing angles are good. The speaker quality is also quite nice and clear. While the headphones provided with the phablet are pretty decent, buy a better pair of headphones to truly enjoy your experience. The phablet supports a variety of multimedia formats including 1080p video playback.   \nConclusion \nThe Lava Magnum X604 is a very impressive phablet what I am very happy to own despite the protests from a bunch of my friends. The phone not only looks impressive, but the performance is quite impressive as well. Definitely the best gadget I own right now!     "]], "title": "Lava Magnum X604"}

NO MHL 3 to HDMI support.   \n2. NO USB 3 / 3.1 &amp; USB type C.   \n3. NO user replaceable Battery.   \n4. NO Micro SD card slot.   \n5. NO IP67 Dustproof or waterproof.   \n6. NO Glove mode for increasing touchscreen sensitivity.   \n7. NO LED indicator notification MENU. Just On or Off option.   \n8. Smaller Battery   \n9. NO Temp &amp; humidity sensor   \n10. Ever increasing size. S4 was just 136mm in lenght and was very compact and convenient. S6 is 8mm longer at 143+mm with marginal increase in screen size.   \n11. It is clear from various drop tests that S6 is not as durable as most Samsung phones in the past.   \n12. No way to sort apps in the app drawer. Only an edit option to manually sort each and every app!! And, No way to move entire app drawer pages for arrangement.   \nHope Samsung incorporates these features in the upcoming Note 5 and S7.   \nPlease like and share this video, so that this message reaches Samsung, and it incorporates these features in the upcoming Note 5 and S7.

As budget and basic the Desire C was it already wowed me back then. over the years I realise what I was using my phone the most for though : taking pictures.   \nSo based on this, I started researching and had more or less my mind set on the HTC Desire 820 before deciding for the M8 Eye.  \nThis was a case of an happy accident, as I decided to go to a store to buy the phone. There the 820 and the M8 eye were side by side, and the size and look of the M8 eye seemed more reasonable. My husband has the iPhone 6+ and he kept saying that as size goes, it is way too big for comfort. The Desire 820 was the same size which was its only negative point.    \nSo we did a quick research in the store, and tested both phones. The M8 eye was the clear winner. A tad smaller than the 820, a better screen resolution, a better look and feel, a body made of metal rather than all plastic and that amazing dual camera in the back that gives great depth and focus to you pictures.   \nSince the camera is what I was the most particular about, it mattered a lot. This one will not disappoint you. It gives very good quality pictures in daylight and well lit settings. Like all cameras that aren't DSLR it will give you less good result in low light. Though I must say that it seems to work better in low light than my 12MP point and shoot camera. For a phone, that is no small feat. \nOf all my camera device I would rate them in this order from lowest quality to highest : iPad 4, point and shoot Sony camera, HTC M8 Eye, and finally my Nikon DSLR.   \nRest of the phone specifics. I am not much of a music listener, so cant comment on the sound quality. I find it good so far. \nI was already used to HTC sense having had an HTC before, but this version is even more user friendly than the one I had on the Desire C.  \nThe phone works smoothly, no lags whatsoever and its screen size makes it very comfortable to browse online, which was a bit annoying to do on my previous phone.   \nThe size is perfect, not too big to be unfofortable to hold or carry and still big enough to give you a good reading experience on it. I think phones should not go bigger than this one. bigfer, like the 820 and you loose on practicality. Let's remember that phones and tablets should stay two different entities.

All in all, it's a good long-term option, especially with Android L expected to roll out soon.   \nIt's a cheaper variant of the M8, but there's no real compromise apart from the camera, which is still decent but not exceptional.

This phone was launched as the flagship phone at around Rs. 22k and within a month the price was dropped to 19K. Today this phone is sold for not more than 14K. I agree that as the product becomes old, the price reduced, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to discontinue a product rather than reducing price and hence the perception value of the brand.   \nSecondly this phone was launched as flagship phone with the latest android at the time of release. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been more than 24 months now, but not a single system update from Panasonic. All the major phone makers have launched Kitkat update for all their flagship phone and preparing for Android Lollipop update.    \nThe major reason for a person to buy an android phone is to experience the android system with timely updates. If you are unable to provide the same then I guess you will never get repeat customers. I will never go with another Panasonic phone ever as I know they will never update to the latest android system.   \nFinally last but the most important for successful product life cycle is the aftersale service. I had few problems with phone and tried to get in touch with the aftersales service provider mentioned on the website. But to my surprise they had ended the contract and the same was not updated on the site. I had to get my phone repaired from an unauthorized repair shop even though my phone was in warranty period.

I myself had to place an order online with a Singapore based exporter for a new display for my P51 after leaving my phone for 40 days at the authorized service-cum-repair shop in my hometown. Jaina Marketing failed to supply the screen for this model so there's nothing this guy running the service-cum-repair shop could do about it. \nI inquired at a few unauthorized centres but all of them told me the same thing: Panasonic P51's screen is unavailable in the market. \nI finally found relief when a received the shipment from Singapore and then I had my P51's smashed screen replaced for Rs.1000 (Although the overall cost was Rs.6700) \nThis sad episode led me to think that buying this phone is a tricky affair; you get great value for your money but, God forbid, if your phone breaks down, you may face a very difficult time getting it fixed.

If you want excellet camera quality then use a proper camera.  \nAlso, you should know how to click a pic as per the evnironment. Don't just blindly blame the camera. \nFlash is little bad, i agree, as compared the flash we get in samsung smartphones. \nInternal MEM of 4GB is also a concern.  \nSome excellent features are: fast response, slim design, light weight, good looks, HD videos/movies, full support for high end android apps and games, quick responsive touchpad and last but not the least LG has a good customer service.  \nYou should also know the tricks and tips on how to get 100% from your phone.

Then, I found dual-sim was a requirement for me; and therefore, Samsung Galaxy Mega 5.8&quot; dual-sim seemed to be the best fit. It came with a complementary 2600 mAh Maxx PBS-26-SDI Smart Charger and Plantronics ML2 Bluetooth Headset. I also bought a Samsung 64 GB MicroSD Pro Class 10 Memory Card for storage and a Hard Armor Bumper Flip Stand Back Case for protection.   \nAfter ~ 6 months of extensive use as a phabletop (phone/tablet/laptop; yes, I defy to define it), my Mega with its 114 downloaded apps (yep, you got it, downloaded, and not native) just works. This is now my Alarm Clock | Calculator | Calendar | Camera | Compass | Dictionary | eBook Reader | Flash Drive | Flashlight | Gaming Console | GPS | Mirror | MP3 Player | Photo Frame | Radio | Scanner | TV | Voice Recorder | Wireless Keyboard &amp; Mouse. Did I tell ya it's a lil computer, too? Oh yes, I now use my laptop only when a particular job is difficult to do here, or cannot be done here at all.   \nMega has 1.5 GB RAM; therefore, despite not having a quad-core processor, it is fast. Never buy a smartphone (especially, android) with less than 1 GB RAM! The screen resolution is qHD, but it looks quite acceptable to me. The design could be better, but you are getting a removable battery here. I like the Charger with USB Charge and Sync Cable. The in-ear headset with volume control is cool, too (my ears cannot hold standard earphones). And, it fits in my pocket (except for tight jeans).   \nComplaints? Not too many\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \nOne issue is that this device works good only with Samsung branded earphones/headphones; well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weird. \nI wish it could run FULL version (and, not mobile version) of Microsoft Office. As of now, no phones or phablets can run full MS Office (I tested it). If, for example, a PowerPoint file having embedded audios, videos, transitions, animations could be read in a phone/phablet as if it were being read in a laptop/desktop, it would be great (I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about office edit capability in a phone/phablet, lemme just read!).   \nThe smart 2600 mAh charger is a nice addition since smartphones need a lot of power. Mega has a 2600 mAh battery (not too good, IMHO), so you should keep an emergency charger like this with you. \nTips: To save battery and to make the phone faster, \n1) go to Settings &gt; More &gt; Developer options &gt; Drawing, and select \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnimation is off\u00e2\u0080\u009d for all. \n2) use \u00e2\u0080\u009cActive applications\u00e2\u0080\u009d widget to stop running unnecessary applications, uninstall unnecessary downloaded applications, clear RAM. \n3) go to Settings &gt; More &gt; Storage and clear cached data.   \nUse the BT headset especially when you are driving.   \n64 GB card is meant for digital life; in addition, I move the downloaded apps to the card whenever allowed (Settings &gt; More &gt; Application manager) since the available internal storage space is not enough. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a class 10 card, so speed is pretty good.   \nThe hard case not only protects Mega but also offers a better grip (it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge phone!). It does not add significant bulk either. It has a foldable stand in the back so that you can use the device as a digital photo frame and a TV.   \nThanks Samsung/Google for creating a phone (?) that offered me an AIO. Thanks also go to Flipkart for awesome combo offer and flawless delivery. And, thanks (but no thanks) to naysayers that I have had a faith on Android.   \nShould you buy this NOW? Well, that depends. Samsung has come up with Grand 2, which is better than this in almost every aspect except for the screen size (Grand 2 has 5.25\u00e2\u0080\u009d, but a better PPI in Grand 2 may compensate for a bit smaller screen).   \nMy dream phablet? Oh well, the unfortunate thing is that dual-sim phablets are not available with very high-end specs (so called flagship category). Gimme a dual-sim phablet (~ 6\u00e2\u0080\u009d) with top-notch specs and MS Office functionality, and I am sold! "], ["Dhruti Randeria", "Not bad!!

"], ["Koushik Das", "Honest Review ", "\n Hi Friends, \nI am writing this review almost after 2 months buying the Note Edge. I will proceed point-wise. And I will not decide if that is under pros or cons, as this might vary person to person.  \n1. Look &amp; Feel- \n Honestly its not a conventional design, so might feel bit awkward to hold (small handed people ;)). But Curved edge looks amazing stunningly bright and dark too. Metal grill edge is good to hold. Back is more plastic than leather. Thanks to the removable back cover.  \nNOTE : Its wider than NOTE 4 but smaller in height.  \n2. Performance - \n I expected more as it is having snapdragon 805 with 2.7 GHz clock speed also equipped with 3 GB of RAM. But not to worry its fluid enough multitasking is fun. Gaming would have been better but some how Samsung made this more for office user not for college goers. Almost every official documentation can be done with an ease. Powerful device with powerful tools. Edge is very useful. Night clock is nice but also having other utilities once use to with it you will miss it.  \n3. Camera- \n Nothing much to say about it, its truly awesome. Video recording is flawless, better than any phone I suppose. Auto focus is bit lagging. Front cam is also well featured 3.7 MP I found great low light imaging is aslo pretty cool I mean nice noise is very less.  \n4. Battery - \n Ahhh not as good as my note 3. Use to manage a complete day with 3 G and wifi connectivity for 24 hours non stop. One thing I must say if you use camera( both video and still photography) for more than 3 hours then battery will drain like hell fast. Screen on time would be hardly 4 hours with automatic display brightness level.  \n5. Other Features- \n S PEN the most powerful here in note edge as well as note 4 yet.  \nEDGE Display is an addition. Its well managed and utilized. I found it very usefull time to time.     \n Over all in my opinion its worth to buy if you are a power user this device wont let you down in any aspect. Call quality reception all are up to the mark. After all its having storage expandability most needed feature. As if you make some 4K recording or want to keep some 4k movies it will take hell lot of storage space.    \nThanks "], ["Amit Khator", "Never Ever buy from Flipkart.

Called up Flipkart Customer Care and told them about the wrong product being shipped and asked for a replacement. Response was not satisfactory as they mentioned that replacement could not be done as the concerned product went out of stock with the given seller. This sounds quite absurd and I felt being cheated because I was never intimated by Flipkart that a Frost White color phone will be shipped to me instead of the black one.    \nFlipkart had mentioned that they will not be able to do a refund to the wallet and to revert the transaction will take 8 working days to reflect in my account. They had left me with no other options now other than using the white one at hand as I have no spare phone with me.

Screen resolution is a treat to ur eyes.   \n2. Battery backup is better than expected(Am a heavy user of mobile. Daily basis I make/receive calls for around 2-3 hours, listen to music for 1-2 hours, videos+surfing net+visiting various websites+gaming adds up to say again 2-3 hours, whats app+FB etc adds up to1-2 hours......at the end of the day i still have enough juice in my mobile). So, in all battery lasts all day long easily.   \n3. Sound is a music to ur ears, even the ringtone is loud enough with awesome clarity.   \n4. Curved Screen is really useful. One can see almost all the notifications in it. When ur doing something in the main screen, u get calls in the edge screen, so no issue of accidentally rejecting/receiving calls. One very important things i guess most of the us had in our mind is that due to the edge screen in the right side, one might accidentally push any App located in the edge screen - well, this phone is smart enough to know whether ur pushing accidentally of knowingly.   \n5. Too slim. Looks heavy and hefty, but slides easily into ur pocket.   \n6. Phone calls sound clarity is too good. Had 2 microphones.   \n7. Back cover looks very premium. Leather finish.   \n8. S-Pen is very useful. Handwriting recognition is very good(I am having worst of the handwritings and this phone recognizes it without much effort.   \n9. Voice recognition is good enough. Understands Indian pronunciations effortlessly.   \n10. Battery Charges up real quick. Checked once, it took exactly 65-70 mins to charge up from 8% to 100%   \n11. Finger print scanner works pretty good. Just wipe ur sweaty finger before scanning.   \n12. Looks to die for. For me, this is the best and smartest and stylish handset Samsung has ever made. Fits in ur palm easily. Bit difficult for one hand operation but again one can use it single handed through an inbuilt option.   \n13. No lagging/hanging whatsoever. Smooth operation even if hell lot of App r opened or playing any heavy game.   \n14. Camera is good enough.Had a pocket full of features in camera. Clicks nice pics and takes full HD videos.   \n15. S Health feature is good for people who r keen in healthy living(exercising, walking, dieting etc). One can check their Pedometer(steps walked), Heart Rate, SpO2(level of oxygen in blood), stress level, UV radiation of Sun etc through S Health.   \nCons: \n1. Price seems to be too high for many.   \n2. No dust/water resistant.   \n3. Need to take care as the edge screen seems prone to break if falls.   \n4. Not always, but at times the back heats up a bit when using camera for long or shooting full HD video for long.   \nOverall, this phone/phablet is a master piece from Samsung.Curved edge screen is a revolution in mobile technology.Looks premium and feels the same.Ofcourse, due to heavy pricing, this might not be a phone for all but yes it's worth the price.People who r using Note 3 or Note 4, Note edge is not a recommended upgrade(Basically, Note 4 and Note Edge r the same except for looks an curved screen). Better wait for Galaxy S 6 with full curved screen(as is expected). "], ["Parth Sabnis", "The future is here ", "\n The Galaxy smartphone series have given the world everything it ever needed, be it budget phones for the teens or even Performance phones for the executives. But with the smartphone market reacing its saturation, the world demanded something new, something futuristic, something cool. Samsung have heeded this prayer , and given us a device, which is nothing short of futuristic. The Edge display was only an idea in the recent past, but looks like we already have its first fully working iteration, in the form of the Galaxy Note Edge. This device was a surprise annoucement after the announcement of the Galaxy Note 4, which in itself is a smartphone beast incarnate. LG had attempted to launch some futuristic tech themselves in the past in the form of the LG G Flex, but that device turned out to be only a prototype with only the flexible screen to talk about. The second iteration of the G Flex, the LG G Flex 2 , however, is a different story. Will the Note Edge also prove to be a prototype , or will it score a debut victory - Lets Find out   \nConnectivity - The Device supports 2G, 3G and 4G connectivity, which conforms with the current industry standard.   \nDisplay -The Note Edge comes with a 5.6 inch QHD display with a resolution of 1600*2560 pixels. What this means is that , the phone features a QHD display along with a 160 px strip along its edge. The extra strip will display notifications, control music among others. The app developers are optimising their apps to support this amazing edge feature as we speak. The pixel density is a stunning 524 ppi. Though the human eye cannot really perceive that pixel density, we can really get the feel of it when we are treated to ultra crisp text even on zooming in to the maximum.The Gorilla Glass protection has been custom made for this device with the glass actually curving to protect the edge as well. The stylus feature is also provided sice it is part of the prestigious Note family. \nPerformance - The Note Edge features the Snapdragon 805 chipset which features a Quad core 2.7 GHz Krait 450 processor. The Adreno 420 GPU rounds off the performance package of the Note Edge. The Krait processor and the 805 chipset are the two top names in the smartphone ecosystem right now, and both of them acting together can only mean one thing - Performance Extravaganza. \nMemory - The Note Edge comes with a mouth watering 3GB of RAM and provides two variants. One with 32 GB internal memory, and the other with 64 GB of internal memory. To add to that, we can also add an external SD card upto 128 GB. This is the best memory package I have seen till date. \nCamera - Samsung have always impressed with their camera packages and this time is no different. We get a 16 MP Rear camera which features OIS , autofocus and LED Flash. A 3.7 MP sensor makes up the &quot;selfie camera&quot;.We can record 4K videos @ 30fps, 1080p@60fps and 720p @120fps.   \nBattery -The Note Edge comes with a 3000 mAh battery. Some might argue that Samsung should have gone with a bigger bettery given the features and the display, but this battery should get you close to day's usage on single charge , so there's no real reason for worry. \nAll in all , this phone has exceeded everyone's expectations. Samsung have not only gone one step ahead and made a revolutionary product, but also made sure that it enters the fray , all guns blazing. Its rather a contrast from what LG had done with their Flex series, but looks like Samsung was in no mood to wait for their second Edge iteration to load it with specs. This phone will not just enthrall the masses but also beat almost any competitor you wish to throw at it. Looks like this phone might just go into the record books, as the prototype that Came, Saw and Conquered. "], ["Rakesh Bhatia", "Worth Price ", "\n Note Edge is worth the price. Cutting Edge Technology and specially side view is amazing. Comparing new technology with other phones for sure is not justified. Flipkart should give facility of Pre Booking also. "], ["Raghav Chaudhary", "Note Edge 2 Months Review ", "\n I picked up Note Edge two months ago in Seoul, Korea, where I am doing an exchange semester. Though the price was a bit less at around 60,000 but with insurance, original cover, no extra accessories and no difference in street price and MRP, it costs roughly the same.Unlike apple where the pricing is a lot different in the states and India, samsung, thankfully has not engaged in any such activities.Moving on to the product itself, the price seeing the recent market trends is completely justifiable. The curved edge of screen does not only look great but adds a ton of functionality. It is easy to look at it and call it a gimmick but till you don't try it out for yourself you won't know what you are missing out on. The edge screen is pretty useful for quick opening up apps and adds a lot of functionality in apps like flipboard, camera app and the default video app. Furthermore, tools like voice recorder, stopwatch,timer, torch and scale can be used without unlocking the device. For people who worry about durability, the phone feels good in hand and gives a good grip thus eliminating any worries regarding it slipping from your hand. The screen is also durable enough including the curve, you probably won't get a glass protector for the curve though. Finally, addressing the biggest fear, no you won't accidentally open up apps from the curve screen, nor is it uncomfortable to hold. I have been using it for two months now, never have I accidentally opened up any application or had any difficulty using the edge screen, it is as responsive as the main screen but has some added features which ensures it know the difference between a palm and a touch. I won't write about other things like the screen, camera or processor because it is the same as note 4. I do know for a fact though that the fingerprint sensor works better on my edge than on my friend's note 4, although my girlfriend's iphone 6 beats both when it comes to fingerprint technology. Final words, the phone looks good, feels good and works amazingly, if you want android this is as good as it gets, I won't include, Vertu and Tag Heur mobiles for obvious reasons, if you are confused between this and iphone both are good but it comes down to your preferred OS, this one just might have the wow factor and will give you the edge you are looking for (pun intended) ;-)   \nP.S. Owners Advise: I don't know if the original flip wallet cover is on sale yet because in Korea it came around 2 weeks after the phone but do invest your money on it, it is of great quality and does add protection but also makes sure that the edge is usable, it also adds a feature called &quot;style clock for flip wallet&quot;, which works well and adds style.

"], ["Koushik Das", "Honest Review ", "\n Hi Friends, \nI am writing this review almost after 2 months buying the Note Edge. I will proceed point-wise. And I will not decide if that is under pros or cons, as this might vary person to person.  \n1. Look &amp; Feel- \n Honestly its not a conventional design, so might feel bit awkward to hold (small handed people ;)). But Curved edge looks amazing stunningly bright and dark too. Metal grill edge is good to hold. Back is more plastic than leather. Thanks to the removable back cover.  \nNOTE : Its wider than NOTE 4 but smaller in height.  \n2. Performance - \n I expected more as it is having snapdragon 805 with 2.7 GHz clock speed also equipped with 3 GB of RAM. But not to worry its fluid enough multitasking is fun. Gaming would have been better but some how Samsung made this more for office user not for college goers. Almost every official documentation can be done with an ease. Powerful device with powerful tools. Edge is very useful. Night clock is nice but also having other utilities once use to with it you will miss it.  \n3. Camera- \n Nothing much to say about it, its truly awesome. Video recording is flawless, better than any phone I suppose. Auto focus is bit lagging. Front cam is also well featured 3.7 MP I found great low light imaging is aslo pretty cool I mean nice noise is very less.  \n4. Battery - \n Ahhh not as good as my note 3. Use to manage a complete day with 3 G and wifi connectivity for 24 hours non stop. One thing I must say if you use camera( both video and still photography) for more than 3 hours then battery will drain like hell fast. Screen on time would be hardly 4 hours with automatic display brightness level.  \n5. Other Features- \n S PEN the most powerful here in note edge as well as note 4 yet.  \nEDGE Display is an addition. Its well managed and utilized. I found it very usefull time to time.     \n Over all in my opinion its worth to buy if you are a power user this device wont let you down in any aspect. Call quality reception all are up to the mark. After all its having storage expandability most needed feature. As if you make some 4K recording or want to keep some 4k movies it will take hell lot of storage space.    \nThanks "], ["Amit Khator", "Never Ever buy from Flipkart. Atleast the costly electronic devices ", "\n Have ordered a Charcoal Black Samsung Note 4 Edge phone from Flipkart. And the product delivered to me was a Frost White one. Called up Flipkart Customer Care and told them about the wrong product being shipped and asked for a replacement. Response was not satisfactory as they mentioned that replacement could not be done as the concerned product went out of stock with the given seller. This sounds quite absurd and I felt being cheated because I was never intimated by Flipkart that a Frost White color phone will be shipped to me instead of the black one.    \nFlipkart had mentioned that they will not be able to do a refund to the wallet and to revert the transaction will take 8 working days to reflect in my account. They had left me with no other options now other than using the white one at hand as I have no spare phone with me.

The edge has some useful functionalities (notifications, app shortcuts, etc). Other things are same as Note 4 except for Battery life. Coming from a xperia Z2 I didnt expect the battery life of Galaxy note edge to be great (as per reviews) but it still lasts throughout the day easily.   \nSo to sum up..if you can shell an extra few bucks and want a different experience than a normal mobile phone, Note edge is for you.

"], ["Abhik Das", "A Masterpiece from Samsung ", "\n Well, I have bought this mobile on 14th January 2015(not from flipkart, but from Samsung Smart Cafe) and was waiting to give my review only after I have used this mobile for a couple of days.So, here it is.   \nHonestly, this set is costly one, no doubt about it, but again Samsung has launched this set with awesome curved screen not for the mass but for the premium customers.   \nPros: \n1. Screen resolution is a treat to ur eyes.   \n2. Battery backup is better than expected(Am a heavy user of mobile. Daily basis I make/receive calls for around 2-3 hours, listen to music for 1-2 hours, videos+surfing net+visiting various websites+gaming adds up to say again 2-3 hours, whats app+FB etc adds up to1-2 hours......at the end of the day i still have enough juice in my mobile). So, in all battery lasts all day long easily.   \n3. Sound is a music to ur ears, even the ringtone is loud enough with awesome clarity.   \n4. Curved Screen is really useful. One can see almost all the notifications in it. When ur doing something in the main screen, u get calls in the edge screen, so no issue of accidentally rejecting/receiving calls. One very important things i guess most of the us had in our mind is that due to the edge screen in the right side, one might accidentally push any App located in the edge screen - well, this phone is smart enough to know whether ur pushing accidentally of knowingly.   \n5. Too slim. Looks heavy and hefty, but slides easily into ur pocket.   \n6. Phone calls sound clarity is too good. Had 2 microphones.   \n7. Back cover looks very premium. Leather finish.   \n8. S-Pen is very useful. Handwriting recognition is very good(I am having worst of the handwritings and this phone recognizes it without much effort.   \n9. Voice recognition is good enough. Understands Indian pronunciations effortlessly.   \n10. Battery Charges up real quick. Checked once, it took exactly 65-70 mins to charge up from 8% to 100%   \n11. Finger print scanner works pretty good. Just wipe ur sweaty finger before scanning.   \n12. Looks to die for. For me, this is the best and smartest and stylish handset Samsung has ever made. Fits in ur palm easily. Bit difficult for one hand operation but again one can use it single handed through an inbuilt option.   \n13. No lagging/hanging whatsoever. Smooth operation even if hell lot of App r opened or playing any heavy game.   \n14. Camera is good enough.Had a pocket full of features in camera. Clicks nice pics and takes full HD videos.   \n15. S Health feature is good for people who r keen in healthy living(exercising, walking, dieting etc). One can check their Pedometer(steps walked), Heart Rate, SpO2(level of oxygen in blood), stress level, UV radiation of Sun etc through S Health.   \nCons: \n1. Price seems to be too high for many.   \n2. No dust/water resistant.   \n3. Need to take care as the edge screen seems prone to break if falls.   \n4. Not always, but at times the back heats up a bit when using camera for long or shooting full HD video for long.   \nOverall, this phone/phablet is a master piece from Samsung.Curved edge screen is a revolution in mobile technology.Looks premium and feels the same.Ofcourse, due to heavy pricing, this might not be a phone for all but yes it's worth the price.People who r using Note 3 or Note 4, Note edge is not a recommended upgrade(Basically, Note 4 and Note Edge r the same except for looks an curved screen). Better wait for Galaxy S 6 with full curved screen(as is expected). "], ["Parth Sabnis", "The future is here ", "\n The Galaxy smartphone series have given the world everything it ever needed, be it budget phones for the teens or even Performance phones for the executives. But with the smartphone market reacing its saturation, the world demanded something new, something futuristic, something cool. Samsung have heeded this prayer , and given us a device, which is nothing short of futuristic. The Edge display was only an idea in the recent past, but looks like we already have its first fully working iteration, in the form of the Galaxy Note Edge. This device was a surprise annoucement after the announcement of the Galaxy Note 4, which in itself is a smartphone beast incarnate. LG had attempted to launch some futuristic tech themselves in the past in the form of the LG G Flex, but that device turned out to be only a prototype with only the flexible screen to talk about. The second iteration of the G Flex, the LG G Flex 2 , however, is a different story. Will the Note Edge also prove to be a prototype , or will it score a debut victory - Lets Find out   \nConnectivity - The Device supports 2G, 3G and 4G connectivity, which conforms with the current industry standard.   \nDisplay -The Note Edge comes with a 5.6 inch QHD display with a resolution of 1600*2560 pixels. What this means is that , the phone features a QHD display along with a 160 px strip along its edge. The extra strip will display notifications, control music among others. The app developers are optimising their apps to support this amazing edge feature as we speak. The pixel density is a stunning 524 ppi. Though the human eye cannot really perceive that pixel density, we can really get the feel of it when we are treated to ultra crisp text even on zooming in to the maximum.The Gorilla Glass protection has been custom made for this device with the glass actually curving to protect the edge as well. The stylus feature is also provided sice it is part of the prestigious Note family. \nPerformance - The Note Edge features the Snapdragon 805 chipset which features a Quad core 2.7 GHz Krait 450 processor. The Adreno 420 GPU rounds off the performance package of the Note Edge. The Krait processor and the 805 chipset are the two top names in the smartphone ecosystem right now, and both of them acting together can only mean one thing - Performance Extravaganza. \nMemory - The Note Edge comes with a mouth watering 3GB of RAM and provides two variants. One with 32 GB internal memory, and the other with 64 GB of internal memory. To add to that, we can also add an external SD card upto 128 GB. This is the best memory package I have seen till date. \nCamera - Samsung have always impressed with their camera packages and this time is no different. We get a 16 MP Rear camera which features OIS , autofocus and LED Flash. A 3.7 MP sensor makes up the &quot;selfie camera&quot;.We can record 4K videos @ 30fps, 1080p@60fps and 720p @120fps.   \nBattery -The Note Edge comes with a 3000 mAh battery. Some might argue that Samsung should have gone with a bigger bettery given the features and the display, but this battery should get you close to day's usage on single charge , so there's no real reason for worry. \nAll in all , this phone has exceeded everyone's expectations. Samsung have not only gone one step ahead and made a revolutionary product, but also made sure that it enters the fray , all guns blazing. Its rather a contrast from what LG had done with their Flex series, but looks like Samsung was in no mood to wait for their second Edge iteration to load it with specs. This phone will not just enthrall the masses but also beat almost any competitor you wish to throw at it. Looks like this phone might just go into the record books, as the prototype that Came, Saw and Conquered. "], ["Rakesh Bhatia", "Worth Price ", "\n Note Edge is worth the price. Cutting Edge Technology and specially side view is amazing. Comparing new technology with other phones for sure is not justified. Flipkart should give facility of Pre Booking also. "], ["Raghav Chaudhary", "Note Edge 2 Months Review ", "\n I picked up Note Edge two months ago in Seoul, Korea, where I am doing an exchange semester. Though the price was a bit less at around 60,000 but with insurance, original cover, no extra accessories and no difference in street price and MRP, it costs roughly the same.Unlike apple where the pricing is a lot different in the states and India, samsung, thankfully has not engaged in any such activities.Moving on to the product itself, the price seeing the recent market trends is completely justifiable. The curved edge of screen does not only look great but adds a ton of functionality. It is easy to look at it and call it a gimmick but till you don't try it out for yourself you won't know what you are missing out on. The edge screen is pretty useful for quick opening up apps and adds a lot of functionality in apps like flipboard, camera app and the default video app. Furthermore, tools like voice recorder, stopwatch,timer, torch and scale can be used without unlocking the device. For people who worry about durability, the phone feels good in hand and gives a good grip thus eliminating any worries regarding it slipping from your hand. The screen is also durable enough including the curve, you probably won't get a glass protector for the curve though. Finally, addressing the biggest fear, no you won't accidentally open up apps from the curve screen, nor is it uncomfortable to hold. I have been using it for two months now, never have I accidentally opened up any application or had any difficulty using the edge screen, it is as responsive as the main screen but has some added features which ensures it know the difference between a palm and a touch. I won't write about other things like the screen, camera or processor because it is the same as note 4. I do know for a fact though that the fingerprint sensor works better on my edge than on my friend's note 4, although my girlfriend's iphone 6 beats both when it comes to fingerprint technology. Final words, the phone looks good, feels good and works amazingly, if you want android this is as good as it gets, I won't include, Vertu and Tag Heur mobiles for obvious reasons, if you are confused between this and iphone both are good but it comes down to your preferred OS, this one just might have the wow factor and will give you the edge you are looking for (pun intended) ;-)   \nP.S. Owners Advise: I don't know if the original flip wallet cover is on sale yet because in Korea it came around 2 weeks after the phone but do invest your money on it, it is of great quality and does add protection but also makes sure that the edge is usable, it also adds a feature called &quot;style clock for flip wallet&quot;, which works well and adds style.

", "\n Don't rate low simply coz u fell price is high..   \nPeople don't complain and bother abt price tags when it's has fruit logo...   \nSpecs wise IPhone 6 = RedMi 1s \nFor price 1 Phone6 = 9 RedMi 1s   \nIf don't like the product or Samsung don't simply underrate....    "], ["gaurav raj", "Not the perfect way yet . ", "\n The phone though brings up something extra over Note 4.  \nBut the thing is ,  \nIs it needed? Will it help? \nIts just a showcase of possibilities aimed by Samsung , \nSo I am not going to scorn at the price . \nWe all know what Samsung has been doing with prices in India.  \nComing to the phone, \nThe minor benefits won't be even that habitual that may make you think that the edge is a bit of necessity.  \nFor this generation 4, \nI recommend to stay to Note 4 even if in future Note Edge is available cheaper than Note 4.  \nThe Added witdth will be the main concern over phablet territory which themselves are hard for portability.  \nYou might be seeing a lot of sweaty fingerprints on the EDGE too as that might always be touching your thumb joint whilst in use.

Dont be surprised if you can't see these devices listed on official panasonic india mobile website. They are yet to update it there,even after being notified of the missing devices.   \n#Highlights and Review \n1) Android Kitkat - Far better than Android Jellybean in terms of Performance. Panasonic has added some useful features on top of it. \n2) Quadcore 1.3Ghz Mtk6582 processor and Mali-400 MP2 GPU - This combination is a well proven one,and is seen on many budget devices in the market.Many high end games can be played without much lag,though some you need to put to medium graphics level. \n3) 1 GB Ram - ensures decent multitasking. \n4) 5 inch LCD display with a qHD resolution (540 x 960 pixels, 220 PPI ) \n5) 8MP Rear and 2MP Front shooter. Good enough for your sharing needs. 1080P video is supported. Low light performance is not good. \n6) 2000mAh battery - can last a day of average use. If you are a heavy user, probably you would need to find a charging port by evening.   \n# Verdict \nP41 has the same processor-gpu combination seen on Rs 7000 one Micromax Canvas Unite 2 and many other under 10K budget 1GB Ram devices. So if you are looking for performance, i think its better to choose other ones that cost lesser and comes with a bigger battery. If you want a good branded one, with a better screen and resolution,and a better camera overall,this can fit your needs. Keep in mind that there are devices from other well known players, xolo,gionee,iball etc at this same price range offering good,if not better specs. For eg, recently announced iball Andi Sparkle ships with an octa core one priced around Rs10500.

Display: superb!!!; believe it or not; for my naked eyes; it looks better than my IPad Mini 2 &amp; Note 2!!!   \n2. Battery: I love it; decent battery back in the first two days of use. Remember, for all smart phones, battery lasts for anything more than a day is fine.   \n3. Smart Band: Who told it is waste; it is nice; but you need to know how it is used and it is not just the Media player, it can be used with other applications as well.    \n4. Look: It looks very slim &amp; sexy; I really love it.   \n5. Camera: Pretty nice 8MP camera with this price tag; it won't disappoint you for sure.   \n6.

I would definitely recommend you all to go with a renowned brand like Samsung, Sony, HTC etc...    \n8. Sound: Pretty nice sound clarity; though I would say none of the phones I ever purchased doesn't match with the sound quality of my old Sony Ericsson W610I   \nCons:   \n1. Headphone: This is one thing I found bad about this phone, out of box headphone is not up to mark; looks like Sony want us to pay for a premium headphone.   \n2. No Android Lollipop update or no news from Sony about the update yet; but Android 4.4 (you can update the phone to 4.4 though out of box is 4.2) is one of the most stable Android OS as of now.   \n3. Looks like there are not enough apps utilizing the features of Smart Band yet; only a few from Sony itself.   \nOver all I'm VERY MUCH SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE \u00ef\u0081\u008a \u00ef\u0081\u008a \u00ef\u0081\u008a \nSo, guys stop blaming; buy it, use it and FEEL IT!! \nAs always hats off to FLIPKART once again for a WONDERFUL GREAT DEAL!!!!

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not made from metal and sits in the middle of HTC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smartphone portfolio. However, its two-tone plastic finish is far from ugly and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solid and easy to grip. I found the finish to be less tacky than the Galaxy S5 and Note 4. \nThe most peculiar thing about the Desire Eye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance is its large front-facing camera.   \nSurprisingly, though, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t distracting and works well. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also nice is the fact that the phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speakers have been placed cleanly at either end of its display. At first glance, it would seem there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any at all. But there are, if you look carefully.   \nDisplay : \nThe Desire Eye comes packed with a 5.2-inch (1080 x 1920 pixels) display, with a density of 424 pixels per inch (PPI). This is virtually the same as HTC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flagship One M8, though that manages a slightly higher pixel density of 441 PPI.   \nColors are sharp and wide-ranged, with darks, in particular, standing out. Like the majority of smartphones, though, colors aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as clear when exposed to daylight. However, this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a major issue, and you can still enjoy your favorite shows and movies while on the go.   \nSoftware : \nThe Desire Eye runs Android KitKat with HTC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sense 6 UI atop. Sense has to be one of the simplest Android UIs out there, unlike Samsung\u00e2\u0080\u0099s TouchWiz, which is cluttered with superfluous animations and functions. Here, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sense of fluency that makes it easy to use and good to look at.   \nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s particularly useful is the BlinkFeed function. Situated on the phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homescreen, it provides you with a list of content you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from newspaper reports to social media updates.   \nAnother nifty feature is HTC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Do Not Disturb Mode, which lets you disable notifications at certain times of the day. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an iOS user, you may have noticed that this is the same name as Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s variant. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both good and get the job done.   \nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full access to the Google Play Store, too, as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect.   \nPerformance : \nSporting a quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor, the Desire Eye is well-equipped. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not up to the standard of the Snapdragon 805, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still powerful enough to provide you with a smooth performance and can handle demanding games like Asphalt 8. \nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage on offer, which can be expanded with an additional up to 128GB via the microSD card slot.   \nThe Desire Eye offers up a 2,400mAh battery, which is smaller than the M8\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by just 200mAh. According to HTC, it has 20 hours of talk time and can last up to 538 hours on stand-by.   \nCamera : \nThe Desire Eye has two 13-megapixel cameras \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one on the front and one on the back. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a dual-LED flash on the front, which means you get to take selfies in the day as well as at night. The only thing different with the front-facer is that it has a smaller aperture. \nThanks to a dedicated shutter button, you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a problem taking photos, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fast shutter speed. You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be disappointed with the overall quality, either, as photos look sharp and colorful. What is worth noting, however, is that images taken in the dark lack detail slightly, and the dual-LED can make photos look washed out. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a problem you get with the iPhone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dual-LED rear flash, but there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a flash on the front.   \nVerdict : \nThis is one of the most selfie-obsessed smartphones out there, so if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re vain, you needn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look any further.   \nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not into your selfies, you may find it inconvenient to have a huge front-facing camera slapped in front of you. That said, the Desire Eye is certainly capable as an all-rounder, with an elegant and strong design, a fast processor and a battery that can get you through the day.

Price : Yes, Apple is a premium phone brand where it cannot go down as a commercial usage mid-range mobiles where a common man of India can afford but the products should worth each penny for which a user is paying what Apple is definitely giving it but for recently launched iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S i have not got the point of pricing of these two devices like 41,900 for 16 GB,53,500 for 32 GB and 53,500 for 16GB,62,500 for 32GB and 71,500 for 64 GB.May be Apple is justifying the price of iPhone 5S for its fingerprint sensor,dual LED flash,64 bit A7 processor with M7 processor for better function of motion sensor which is twice as fast as its previous generation iPhone 5 but iPhone 5C where C stands for color,Apple announced it as a replacement of iPhone 5.   \nSpecification of iPhone 5 and iPhone 5:   \niPhone 5C: \nscreen: 4' diagonal with retina eye display \nprocessor: A6 chip processor \ncamera:8MP iSight camera and front facing 1.2MP Facetime camera capable of 720p recording   \n iPhone 5: \nscreen: 4' diagonal with retina eye display \nprocessor: A6 chip processor \ncamera:8MP camera and front facing 1.2MP Facetime camera   \nThe only difference is with new launch of iOS7 iPhone 5C is comparatively more compatible for iOS7 than iPhone 5 and better secondary camera which is not considerable in India.   \nWhen media asked Tim Cook the CEO of Apple Inc. that people expected iPhone 5C as a cheaper version of iPhones but Apple has disappointed the users so Tim Cook had given an statement that &quot; They are not into Scrap business they are premium phone sellers&quot;.   \nSo, Mr.Cook What is your answer for iPhone 5C where people thought C for Cheap but for you it was C for color.Don't you think its looking like a Chinese brand mobile than an Apple product and on above that the aggressive pricing only because you have considered yourself as a premium phone sellers.   \nMy verdict is iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 were the best products that Apple had produced till date and i have bought iPhone 4S for the price and unavailability of iPhone 5 and i don't regret that for a matter of 10k i have missed iPhone 5 because my requirement is fulfilled with iPhone 4S. \nThe 5 stars what i have given here for flipkart for quick service and for my device iPhone 4S not for Apple.

The grip is still good thanks to the textured back but then this one is plastic &amp; doesn't feel premium .It's less than half the price of the G3 so you can't expect much .The thin bezel definitely makes the screen look bigger &amp; adds to the aesthetics of the phone. Power &amp; volume rockers (can be used to click pictures) are the only buttons which are at the back similar to the G3. The phone weighs in at around 163 gms.  \nThe stylus is a good addition but there's no real use or specific apps which make it mandatory, could've just made the phone without it. Can be used though if you want to take quick notes. It's nothing like the pressure sensitive S Pen, just a basic stylus with a rubber tip.  \nThe display is 5.5&quot; qHD with a lowly resolution of 960x540 @ 200 ppi but you won't notice any issues with the display in terms of colours , contrast if you hold it without this knowledge. It still looks great &amp; definitely no corning gorilla glass here !  \nIn terms of specs, it's a quad core Mediatek MT6582 @ 1.3 Ghz &amp; Mali-400MP2 GPU. 1GB RAM &amp; 8GB internal memory with an expandable option of up to 32GB via a Mico SD slot. It's got a beasty battery at 3000mAh &amp; you'll need it when your phone display uses up most of it , esp. when it's a 5.5 incher. Overall kind of &quot;last year&quot; in terms of H/W in my opinion . 4.4.2 out of the box with a neat &amp; attractive LG UI is a welcome change though . Apps can work on dual window mode which can help you do your work more efficiently &amp; is a win-win feature.    \nComing to the camera bit , the rear one snaps at 13MP @ 4128x3096 with autofocus &amp; LED flash , comes out great in daylight esp . Geo tagging, touch focus &amp; panorama are other added features. Video shooting @1080p with 30fps is also good quality . Most disappointing bit is the 1.3MP front cam which is outright disastrous !

"], ["Ashish Agrawal", "Z3 not waterproof nor a perfect water resistant phone. ", "\n Please do not buy Xperia Z3 thinkin it as waterproof. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not waterproof. In my experience its not even water resistant. Even sony isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure what it is.    \nThe website claims it to be &quot;Waterproof&quot; under the condition that    \n&quot;all ports and attached covers are firmly closed; you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take the phone deeper than 1.5 m of water and for longer than 30 minutes; and the water should be fresh water&quot;   \nBut the authorized service center guys and the customer care claim it to be &quot;Water resistent&quot; and refrain from even using the word &quot;waterproof&quot;.   \nI had purchased an Xperia Z3 on jan 2015. On June 25th, I was travelling back from my office. It started raining heavily. The phone was in my pocket and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother to keep it in my bag as it was said to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cWaterproof under 1 meter water for 30 minute, if all the ports are closed properly). I made sure that the ports are closed.After reaching home in about 15 - 20 mins, I found out that it was not working.    \n I went to the sony service on sat (June 27th) and they said that the phone was water damaged and they do not entertain such cases under warranty. They started telling me that I will have to get it repaired outside of warranty for a nominal charge of Rs. 30,000 (when the phone cost is only 40K). I explained them that I followed all the instuctions (Such as closing all the port's cover and making sure that the phone is not under 1 meter of water) under which you guerentee the phone to be waterproof. Now the cover won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t open itself when it is inside my pocket and unless its flodding,which was not the case, the phone wont be under 1 meter just by rain water. For this they said that an electronic product can never be waterproof, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is just a marketing gimmick\u00e2\u0080\u009d. They kept showing me a litmus paper benath the ports which has turned red as water has entered the phone. I tried explaining them that I understand that water has entered the device but my question is how?   \nIf water has entered the phone despite all the coveres being closed, then the only possible reason could be that the port's cover are loose in fitting which is a manufacturing flaw, or a faulty design. Whatever it is, I am not responsible for it. If this device can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even sustain rain water while inside pocket, how can it be waterproof or even water resistant for that matter.   \nI had no luck at the service center, so I called up the customer care, who surprisingly are very rude, and they asked me to write a mail to the sony service head at Hyderabad. I did that on 30th June. Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t receive any reply from them. So I again sent the mail, this time to a different address. I got a prompt reply from their executives within 48 hours. They had asked me to bring my phone to the service centre for check up. All the service centre did was take some snaps of the phone and checked the covers and pronounce them to be intact. After 15 days, I get a reply from sony saying me \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe cannot cover your product under warranty as it has been water damaged and water has entered the device\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Which brings the entire episode to chapter 1.   \nThe thing that they explained me after 18 days of examination, I knew it the very hour. It preety simple that if a phone is damaged, after getting exposed to water, then water has entered inside it. The big question is HOW??    \nMy question to sony was how did it get damaged,   \nDid I break the device somehow so that the water leaked in (My fault)   \nDid the ports open up on itself because of a physical damage (My fault)   \nIf no physical damage is there and the port opens up on itself (Designer fault)   \nIf everything is fine and still water enters the device (Sony\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manufacturing defect)   \nI never dropped my phone under 1m of water for 30 mins while purchasing the phone (I should have done that) because if it were a manufacturing defect then we would have known it at that instant.   \nI would also like to ask sony what is the IP rating of this device, because in all the mail communications that I have received you guys have mentioned it as IP 55/58, whereas in your website I can see it as IP 65/68. So Is \u00e2\u0080\u009cWaterproof\u00e2\u0080\u009d actually a marketing gimmick?

", "\n Well, first of all I loved the way Big B held LG4 in that promotional pic on LG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s site. The class and elegance it showed in that pic, made me buy this phone.  \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t research about the phone at all, but Big B was one more factor for me to burn close to 50K on this phone.  \nAfter using this phone for a week, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if I have made the right decision. You will know why am saying this. Am not going to talk about all the good things about this phone, for that, LG has already created a damn good site. Go there and check out the specs, features, and amazing photos. Am going to talk about my real experience with this phone, so here it is: \n- Fluctuating Price: I have never seen the price of a product fluctuating even before it is officially launched. LG broke my perception about stable pricing. Even before G4 was officially launched, you could buy it from 45,000 to 50,000. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your bargaining skills that would fetch you a deal you want. This price variation is very scary. Imagine you buy this phone for 49,999 and your friend comes and tell you that s/he bought it for just 40K. Believe me you will feel bad! LG should have controlled the pricing of its phone at least before the official launch. Shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they? \n- Heat: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already very hot in most parts of India, buying this phone would only increase your body temperature. I used it for 30 minutes for Google maps and then I got a call, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep this phone on my ear. It was that HOT! Agreed, that you have got one of the better processor on board, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to use the most basic feature of this phone. After installing Temperature Guard app, I noticed that the battery temperature reached 46 degree Celsius. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to switch my off! On the other side, I believe it is LG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marketing strategy wherein they would want G4 customers to buy an LG AC ;). Why should I? \n- Battery: has no life! If you plan to use this phone for gaming, net surfing, chatting, and of course calling, then please keep the spare battery on charging \u00e2\u0080\u0093 always! This phone can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handle even 2-3 hours of usage. Today, I checked the amount of time it would take to charge the battery which was at 15% - it took 2 hours 15 minutes to charge it to 100%. Though the company claim 100% charge in 1 hour 10 minutes. Imagine your girlfriend wants to make a call using your fancy phone, but you tell her to wait because you want to change the battery. How many times have you replaced your phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battery? At least I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done that even once, but LG expects me to do that with G4. But again, why should I? \n- Performance: better processor, more onboard RAM, but is it really fast? I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just pretty much the same as my previous Sony Xperia Z Ultra. If you are looking for a really superfast phone, well, you might be disappointed.  \nOthers have already reported problematic touchscreen issue, so watch out for it as well.  \nWith all these issues already, I hope LG really resolves these issues and makes it a real flagship phone, not a fault-shipped phone!

", "\n Got this mobile from a retail store about 10 days back and boy what a mobile this is!!!  \nI'll give you an overview of what i am experiencing with this mobile.    \nDISPLAY :- It is one of the best. Its hard to take ur eyes off the screen. Colours are optimally saturated to make things vibrant (not too vibrant as in samsung). At max setting the display is bright and outdoor visibility wont be a problem. Add to this the slight curve and the compact 5.5inch form factor and u have got an awesome display in ur hands.  \nPERFORMANCE :- The Snapdragon 808 as LG claims, seems to be nicely optimised for this mobile. There have been no hiccups so far. The graphics processor could have been a bit powerful though. Nevertheless, it will very much suffice ur daily usage and the occasional gaming sessions.  \nUI :- This is one area where LG has evolved a lot. The UI is a lot smoother and it runs without any lags. LG hasnt compromised on the customisability. Bloatware is minimal and there are a few nice touches that will make using this mobile a lot easier (eg- smart cleaning, double tap to wake, dual window etc etc).    \nCAMERA :- This is perhaps the best smartphone camera available now. Needs no introduction. Its AWESOME. The camera UI is minimal without any unnecessary filters. Most of the times u will find that the Auto mode will suffice, but if u have a bit of photography knowledge, Manual mode is what u would love the most. Ability to adjust the White Balance (in Kelvin values), Shutter speed (from as low as 1/6000 to as high as 30secs), Iso (50-2700), Exposure and Focus is a boon for those who want the best shot possible. Add to this the the ability to save the image in RAW format and u perhaps cant go wrong with this camera. Most of the times people compare this camera to that of S6, but believe me this one is the clear winner. The S6 produces great shots no doubt, but in low light this is the camera u wud want. Daylight pictures are more or less same for both except the fact that S6 produces images that are a lot saturated and may apparently look better to the eye. Same goes for the front camera as well. At 8mp, this is one of the best selfie camera.  \n A few cons regarding the camera :-  \n 1. Video recording and audio capture is not the best. The aggressive OIS makes videos wobbly and audio capture is not that good. There is no 60fps 1080p mode which is a bummer. \n 2. The camera tends to over expose and sometimes u will find the background light to be blown out.  \n 3. Post processing is quite aggressive and occassionally u may note some artefacts(while u have zoomed in to the image).   \nBATTERY :- Despite the fact that this is a 2k display, i have so far always got a Screen on time of 4-4.5hrs, which is quite good. Moreover, the back is removable and u can easily swap the battery. LG is providing an extra battery and battery cradle charger for those who pre-order/buy the mobile before 15th june. The mobile supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0, but quick charger doesnt come out of the box. The provided charger (of 1.8Amps) charges a bit slow and it will take around 120-130mins for a full charge from 0% (provided u dont use the mobile during charging orelse charging rate will slow down even more).  \nPRICING :- 49990 has now become a standard price tag for flagships and this phone is no exception. But since S6 and i6 are now available for a much lower price, its going to be hard for LG to attract customers (although G4 variant launched in India is dual sim and LG is providing free 3 months screen replacement alongwith 1leather + 1plastic back cover). However, having used this mobile for quite some time now, i must say this smartphone is totally worth the price.    \nAll in all this a great phone and certainly one that i will suggest to people in hunt for a flagship. The cons are not deal-breakers and im sure u wont even think about those after a few days.     "], ["Dilip Rathore", "The LG G4 is a great smartphone ", "\n LG has stuck with Android features that long-time users have come to love, and built a great smartphone on top of it.    \nLG is sticking with a removable back cover and battery, and a microSD slot for expandable memory, these are fantastic features to have in any smartphone specially if you are a power user.  \nThe G4's 16MP camera is fantastic and one of the best in the business - it has an f/1.8 aperture, allowing more light to reach the sensor, which is helpful in low-light conditions. It also has an auto laser focus feature that uses infrared detection to determine the focusing distance.  \nAll in all a fantstic phone enriched with so many user friendly features that everyone will love and care to have.

It is one of the best phones in the market right now and with a launch price of 49k it is as good if not better than all flagships. \nSince you all can read about the specs im not going to be including them here, ill just tell you about the phone. \nThe LG OS is very simple and similar to stock android with minimal LG skinning and extremely smooth and lag free interface. \nthe new IPS LCD although not as vibrant and saturated as the super amoled displays, is excellent with increased brightness and very good outdoor visibility. Much better than the previous LG flagships. It delivers very accurate colours as good as a TV. \nThe camera is just breath taking, with details that burst at you and dont pixelate even on zooming in. The camera has a manual mode for all you budding photographers out there, with adjustment for all settings (white balance, focus, shutter speed,etc) \nIt will give you the best shots out there, and with its 1.8 ap lense(smaller number being better light capture) it captures vibrant and bright night shots also. \nThe front camera at 8mp is the best in its category with exact colour reproduction and amazing detail in your selfies as well, and several gestures and voice operands to click a selfie, making it easier to operate with one hand. \nThe only flaw would be the video recording which because of it OIS(optical image stabilization)along with laser auto-focus turns out weird sometimes with choppy and dizzy effects. But still not of bad quality as such with great audio recording quality, and this isnt a deal breaker for me since i anyways prefer clicking snaps. \nThe processor along with 3gb ram together give monster outputs and the 6 cores in no ways is slower than the 8 cores on the 810 snapdragon processor, atleast it isnt noticable with day to day heavy and medium usage. So basically it can handle all your heavy duty game and multitasking with several apps open with ease. \nThe removable back cover with removable battery and option for an sd card is an absolute treat with major flagships doing away with this much needed feature. \nThe battery is weak as with a quad HD display at 5.5 inch and having to push those large number of pixels is very battery draining, not to mention lollipop which although advertised to consume less battery still drains more due to its animations.It can get through a day of medium usage(surfing,texting,watsapp,fb,etc) with say about 6-8 hours on screen time. \nYou could keep a spare battery, but that isnt my cup of tea. \nSound output is decent and I personally dont like the back mounted speaker although audio output is clear without disturbance, just not so tactfully placed. \nThe phone is very beautiful with a large variety of options available for choices (plastic/steel mix, ceramic finish, and leather finish), the bezels (area surrounding the screen) are a little larger than the G3 although a slight curve completely makes you forget about the size difference which is anyways very small. \nThe back buttons work like a charm with different materials used for the volume rocker and power key. The index finger rests well on the buttons and once you get used to that, you'll find yourself looking for back buttons on all smart phones. The double tap to sleep and wake screen are a must for everyone as this does away with the usage of the power key almost completely and increases durability of the button as well \nConnectivity is great, what you'd expect from a flagship with negligent drops sometimes.   \nPersonally this is my favorite phone in the market now, although i give it a 4 star, due to the high pricing, choppy video playback(due to laser autofocus) and not upto the mark battery, otherwise its just too good to be true, and you have to try it to believe it!

First of all let me share my experience with this phone.    \nAs far as the built quality is concerned, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just awesome. in last one year i accidently dropped my phone almost 10 times sometimes from table sometimes from my bike. Never seen any single crack sign or performance degradation ever not even a scratch.   \nScreen is just awesome. And the most important gift it's camera. The 20.7 MP camera is just amazing. One can straightaway compare the picture quality with any of the DSLR. Thanks to Sony's dedicated camera app.   \nNow the most important point. The performance. Before lollypop update it was one of the best ,BUT after the Lollypop update i can say it's average. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why Sony is forcing this device with a new update even though it's not designed to take all of them. After the L update, i an noticing considerable lag , mostly while playing games if you want to switch to the home screen, everything goes blank not even a single icon is visible. This will persist for more than 10 seconds and suddenly everything will be normal again. I can bet this was not the case for KitKat because i have used this phone with KitKat from last 8-9 months and never saw this lag. Sony needs to work in this. \nThe music and sound quality is best as always with Sony. Thanks to clear audio that now you can listen your favorite songs with ultra-clear sound .

Much better than Samsung phones \nCamera :- One of the best i've seen so far. I have almost stopped using DSLRs for my short trips. \nRAM :- 2 GB RAM, at any given point of time at least 500-600 MB is available. so fairly good. Sometimes, i've seen the phone go slow while playing a few high resource consuming games. but very good overall performance \nForm Factor: its very comfortable to hold. Perfect size.Not too large, not too small. \nWater resistant : Yes it is. no problem in rain or elsewhere. \nSound : Excellent quality. WhatsApp/Viber or Normal calls, or songs.   \nCons: \n1. Heating :- Sometimes the phone gets heated. I've seen temperatures of 46 Celcius sometimes. It happens with resource hungry games &amp; even charging. it is kind of expected but when phone gets heated up, the touch screen acts funny and there's no option but to either wait for it to cool or restart. \n2. Charging flap :- The phone is waterproof, but that is mainly because of the flaps provided as covers. the problem is since the phone is being everyday by opening the charging flaps, the flaps do tend to break. At least mine did once. had to replace it (inexpensive but it happens)   \nOverall a very nice phone. Phone does tend to be slow as memory shrinks. I fixed it by taking complete backup (once in the year) and restore from backup. Phone became as fast as it was when i bought it (I've ~130 apps including stock apps).

But for this price no phone can dare to challenge its benefits. 2yrs of updates is not worth ignoring!    \nDoesn't hang anywhere. I switch between apps fast and it responds fast. Updated to 5.1 lollipop next day and it boosted battery backup and speed both.  \n5.1 lollipop has battery save mode in options and it really works. \nFull HD 1080p recording from rear camera. HD recording from front camera. You will be happy with camera. However i compared it with Redme 1S and its below that standard. However its battery backup is better than Redme in spite of being 1700mAh.  \nI have used 8MP camera and this 5MP is better than that. If you are interested in higher MP then you can consider buying external lenses for phones for optical zoom upto or above 12X.  \n- Audio quality is high. I tested Phillips headphone and Xiaomi's piston with. \n- Speakers are good and have enough volume, don't know about MMX android one or spice. Ppl are complaining of low spkr vol. I didn't experienced it on Sparkle V. \n- Phone is thin, slides and fits well in pockets! \n- Screen is 4.5 but bottom bar is occupied with NavBar which eats some screen. If you have problem with that like i had then there are &quot;Xposed modules&quot; to hack these things. Needs rooting. This NavBar was made to offer a standardized layout and responsive buttons.  \nThere are some problems as well, these are common with 90% of Kitkat, lollipop phones - \n- If you do not have data pack in SIM then just after booting the phone turn internet off or you loose your balance. It happens on almost all phones i think. \n- SDCARD is required to use camera, why would you not use sdcard? problem solved. \n- File Manager is absent, you cannot send APK files from other phones using bluetooth. Use some other method.  \n- Its flooded with Google apps, beware of background data consumption. I have restricted background data on Google Play Services. It ate 450MB without any notification. I have no idea what it did. It didn't update the ROM. I am hating Google apps for this reason. Uninstalling Google Services reboots phone. \n- You might not enjoy the white theme of Lollipop and many layout changes. As i am not, the best color in Android i liked was Orange (Froyo). But Lollipop layout is better than KitKat but poor that Jellybean.  \nI strongly recommend this phone.

", "\n After having a good experience with Panasonic T21, again I went for Panasonic after comparing it with other competeters Lenovo S850, Canvas Nitro and Xolo Q1000S..   \nI wonder how people think a lot before choosing Panasonic Brand !! Come ON!!! Read something about Panasonic in the internet before &quot;thinking&quot; !!    \nNow about the phone... \nPerformance wise the phone has no doubt at all. People commented about the RAM. But 1 GB RAM is enough for a OCTA CORE phablet , unless you minimize one game to run other!! 2 GB could have been better of course...(In an i5 laptop you need 3 GB of RAM to run a 30 GB game, so what is the app size you expect in a phone??)   \nAbout GAMING !! GO FOR THIS DEVICE..the 5.5 inch octacore device is just awesome for gaming...more than I imagined...It runs games like FIFA and Nova like butter. And the good thing is that after hours of play you wont find heating in this device.   \nAbout battery..I ve not tested properly..Coz after getting this phone It has been used continuously..But still It is good.. Panasonic has given an in built power manager to deliver good back up..   \nFor Readers..I wld suggest P81 over Kindle Devices..This phone can lower the brightness to a very low level..very low indeed...you wont face difficulties after hours of ebook reading...   \nAnd 13 MP camera is very good indeed. The UI is also quite good.. I liked it over the traditional android UI.    \nCons till now... \nSometimes I am finding problem talking in the mouth piece of the ear phone.. I could not yet figure this thing out..But must be a settings problem..

", "\n Hi friends this is ashok i bought this mobile last month after used this mobile over a month i came here to share about this. \nFirst of all the mobile is best at this price. I didnt find more issues except few things but the over all performance of the mobile is great at this price range.   \nAbt spec: \n1.Look: its looks very very light n very slim n great back n very nice look. \n2.Display:5.5&quot; great for using but not a gorrilla glass. \n3.camera: super quality both back and front in bright light but in dull light we cant expect the same. \n4.Battery:Extraordinary 25 hundred mah gives a backup throught a day even watching movies,playing games etc. \n5.processor:octa core doing a very great job not at all a bit of lag n hanging yet. \n6.Ram:It is provided with 1gb ram but it doesnt a problem even after installd many apps still 200mb is free. \n7.sound:clear speakers and headset sound quality is good. \n8.No heating(Except playing gta)   \nQueries:   \n1. It is powered by android 4.2.2 jelly bean bt when we look through it. it doesnt shows the jelly bean symbol dont know whether it is original or not. Apart from that there is no legal updates for kitkat and lolipop.   \n2.Going through the specifications in several websites they put the battery is non removable but the mobile is with removable one and also in websites they provide that it has micro sim but it is given with normal sim only. Got confused in this area whether the mobile i got is original or not.   \n3.I found heating problem while playing gta.After sacrificed the game not at all a bit of heating.   \nconclusion:   \nThe overall performance of the mobile is really great specially the battery performance and display size those who intrested in 5.5&quot; just go with it. A good phone at this range.Impressed by panasonic.Thanks panasonic.

Rest all feature functionality is very good and battery back up is decent.

", "\n If you are comparing BB10 with Andriod, Windows or iOS then please read the following reviews.    \nA smartphone is the one which satisfy all your needs without kill your daily routine. Blackberry is first smartphone maker long before Apple and Andriod which actually provide service without any glitch. Fact state that still there are many BBOS 2 , 3, 4 ,5 ,6 user in world . You must have seen BB flip phone which are actually discontinue for years.This is due to blackberry high self life of 5 years or more and support even after discontinuing of production.( please tell at least 10 out of thousand andriod phone which have such high self life) . Now let check Z30.   \n1. OS - its smooth , quick and upgradable to latest and upcoming os and free from crashes. Fact if Andriod crash 3 times and apple crash 1 and than BB 0 in a given year.( please tell at least 10 out of thousand andriod phone which will be upgrade to latest OS and upcoming os within 1 month of its release.) Don't listen to people who say it is hard to learn , believe me people who use andriod actaully don't know how to use it fully. Even iphone is hard to learn .    \n2. Screen - 5 inch and made in such a way that it can be use by single hand. (Please note anti blackberry reviewers don't write this in there review)   \n3. Apps - Blackberry provide most of its apps by building itself- Facebook, Twitter, weather , office documents, calender, Whatsapp , bbm , adobe reader, dropbox, compass, print, gtalk, yahoo messengers, password keeper, , travel, microsoft one drive and so on. This is done to protect users data to get free from snoopers. Now you download any extra app from amazon to bb. BB now allow andriod apps on there os. Please use only Amazon becuase after Apple and BB only Amazon makes multi check for malware apps before releasing. All beast developer like EA , Gameloft and even Rovio have there games for BBOS for Blackberry world itself. So virtually there is no term call ' lack of apps'. Every app is optimise for Z30 thus no compatibility issue.   \n4. Camera- if you think greater MP means greater picture quality then please read this. MP actaully means zooms , so higher MP means higher zoom. Remember Nokia 41MP camera add , it was actaully about zooming not quality. Camera of mobile depends on sensors .Check of camera quality of iphone 8MP and HTC 4 MP and any high MP camera you will find HTC wins!! If want to zoom buy standlone camera instead . Please don't look for camera in phone they don't stand a chance against standlone camera. Z30 camera is just good . Front camera need is just 1 MP but BB give 2MP which is great for Selfie.    \n5.

RAM depends on phone OS . Blackberry gove high RAM to support and run its high end games. You can download high end games on any andriod phone but cannot run them because it will kill the phone.    \n7. Data - 16 GB is more than too much .   \n8.

After the last update BB can download apk files directly from websites and install it(besides the apps from BB World).   \nPROS:   \n1)Hardware is the best in smartphone world and has a premium touch to it.  \n2)Runs all app (both native apps and android apps) very well.  \n3)No lags,no reboots, snappy response. \n4)No special subscriptions for using BB services like email and bbm necessary like on previous versions(OS 7). \n5)New UI, fresh and innovative. OK BB has redefined the usual standards in UI. Its nothing like anything out there. UI unlike other phones does not having the same boring type of User Interface. \n6)Got Dual speakers! So, blast them away!  \nCONS:   \n1) Camera focus speed is slow.( very irritating sometimes). Again it can be fixed by a software update which i guess BB would soon do.   \n2) Doesn't have Quad core processors like most high end phones.( By the way,I felt no need for a Quad core processor as it crushed all the apps which i threw at it without even flinching).   \nThats all.

When my last phone, BlackBerry Z30 drank a full cup of tea after one and half years of faithful service, I had to buy another phone. I never liked Android or iPhone (those are so common) and never liked phones with display size bigger than 5&quot;. So my search began. I don't care much about benchmarks or \u00e2\u0080\u0098specs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (I think that is an obscene and ugly word) as long as the phone performs the tasks I ask it to do.   \nThe phones in my radar were   \n1. BlackBerry Passport (YUP! I am a fan) \n2. Jolla \n3. Nokia Lumia 930.   \nI did not choose Passport because I thought Windows would be a good platform. Jolla, well I must admit that the OS and the philosophy behind it all fascinated me. However the platform did feel in need of a bit more maturity.    \nOrdered Nokia Lumia 930 from Flikart on 14th March 2014 for a price of 27927/-. In a week I ordered \u00e2\u0080\u009c Ahha Black Cover\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cNokia DT1-900\u00e2\u0080\u009d wireless charger too. \nThanks a lot Seller WS Retail for super-fast delivery as usual. I got the phone loaded with Lumia Denim Update. Later on I got Windows 8.1 GDR2 as well.   \nNow about the Lumia Experience - 5 things those I like.   \n1. Very fluid and stable operating system. Windows 8.1 (with GDR2 ) reasserts itself in the stability field and even gives tough competition to BlackBerry 10.   \n2. ROCK SOLID build quality. I love the weight (manly!), metal frame (Premium) and polycarbonate back with angled sides. So solid to hold. Very professional in look and feel. \n3. Amazing display and that too with Corning Gorilla glass 3 protections. The colours are so vivid and reading kindle books are easy on eyes. The experience (for 'spec' lovers, 1920x1080 resolutions and 441 ppi) is much better than my Z30 and the difference in performance is evident.   \n4. Camera!!! I own a Lumia 1020 and a Pureview 808. Though 930 doesn't hold a candle against the performance of those dedicated cameras, it holds its own against most of the other phone cameras in its league or a bit more. It has got OIS to boot. The quality is better than Facebook / instagram and even good to printable photos if you know how to use various settings.   \n5. Qi charging, 32 GB space, MS Office, good keyboard with decent word prediction, notification panel, and yes! Here maps.    \nWhat I don't like. (Not specific to 930 alone, but with Microsoft as well)   \n1. Infamous apps gap. To give some examples, major bank application I use does not work well like they do in BlackBerry 10. Kindle version of Windows is total mess. WhatsApp still does not have all the features those available in other platforms. Some major messaging clients are not available (though I don't use them). So is the sync issues and feature limitation with Facebook and Linkedin clients.   \n2. Phone heating up. Though many reviews justify this as a &quot;feature&quot;, I find it very annoying most of the times and outright uncomfortable sometimes.   \n3. No pc suite and Microsoft Outlook integration? Come on Microsoft! Why should we install PAID third party software to perform simple thing like connect Microsoft Outlook, sync windows contacts and take backup etc.? Is it logical for us to expect Microsoft phone to interact with other Microsoft productivity tools? Even BlackBerry 10 can do that perform these tasks if we use BlackBerry link. No way can I get my official Microsoft calendar to my Microsoft windows phone without using some expensive services! Please bring back something like Nokia suit to help us.   \n4. File uploads and downloads. Why so much restrictions? Don't Microsoft thing that we are mature enough to understand the risks and take responsibility of our actions?    \n5. Multi-tasking. I love BlackBerry 10 for providing seamless multitasking. I wish Microsoft provide somewhat similar experience to me - allowing me to minimize and maximize applications I use. That feature is available, but not as seamless as BlackBerry 10 (there, the word again).   \n6. Camera low light performance. This is not good especially when Nokia proved that low light photography can be made an amazing experience with 1020 and 808. I could have happily paid some extra money if Nokia / Microsoft improved this aspect. \nConclusion.   \nI have a love hate relationship with Lumia 930 at present - at a ratio of 70:30. This is a solid product, the last major product from Nokia. I would have recommended to everyone if I had not experience the amazedness of BlackBerry 10 platform. Still I can't stop admiring the qualities of this phone. Neat and efficient phone with a host of power features.    \nWould I get another Lumia as my next phone? Probably. However I look at BlackBerry first and foremost. Have to see if Jolla comes with a real killer phone as well.

"], ["Pranjal Patowary", "Flagship device with flagship functionalities and flagship build quality ", "\n After using Android for five years from 2010 to 2015 and using the Galaxy S and the Galaxy S2 , it was a very nice experience on Android for me. I even used Cyanogen Mod to customize. However, Android got infected by diseases like battery drain,random reboots, memory full errors ,etc. Google's platform was alright but thought of taking a plunge to Microsoft to enable effortless syncing between my PC and mobile. So straightaway went for the Lumia 930. Following points can be summed up :   \n1. Build quality : It is solid and based on Nokia's Industrial design. I got the black one as it was retailing cheap. The last of Windows flagship to brand the Nokia badge, the 930 weighs at 167 grams which is quite heavier than the Galaxy S2(110g) but it is usable. The back cover is not removable and the entire phone is made of single piece of polycarbonate with matte finish. Build quality is much superior to other smartphones.   \n2.Windows ecosystem: Windows Store has about 0.34 million apps till date which is much lower than the 1.4 million figure of iOS and Google. However 95% of the majorly used apps are there. Initial signing on to the device requires Windows login.The OS itself is polished and the Modern UI of Windows is carried over to the Phone version as well. Live Tiles on Home screen are impressive which displays real time updates inside the tiles of various apps . Microsoft is going to unify the Desktop and mobile stores with the release of Windows 10 and this flagship is surely getting the update. Another sore point is Google doesn't release any of their apps for the Windows Phone but Microsoft releases theirs in Android. Just increased my negative vibes about Google as a company and their monopolistic behavior.   \n3.Hardware config: The quadcore Snapdragon 800 is a beast and although its a year old, it bears no mark of ageing. Swiping ,browsing, changing of interfaces, playing videos, playing games and video recording are a breeze. 2GB RAM is also quite helpful in boosting up the performance and there are no lags unlike Android. In fact I find the Windows OS to be much better optimised on comparable phones than Android. In built storage is 32 GB and usable space is about 26 GB excluding the space occupied by the OS. However it is not expandable which would have been a much welcome feature. Microsoft/Nokia should have provided SD card feature on a flagship device like this. The phone features wireless charging and is compatible with the Qi wireless charging standard.   \n4.Optics: The 20 megapixels rear camera is the best in the market and performance is yet to be surpassed by any competing phone on any platform only with the exception of the Lumia 1020 which featured a massive 41 megapixel camera. Photos taken on auto mode are excellent without any blur and is saturated with full optimization. .The rear camera features 6 lenses provided by Carl Zeiss and has Optical Image stabilization which is not affected by any sudden movement or jerks. Lumia sofwares including the Lumia Camera is by far the best camera software I have seen and supports many advanced customizations. Photos can be saved as 5MP + 16MP on 4:3 format or as 5MP + 19MP on widescreen 16:9 format. Video recording is also superb and sound quality recorded is enhanced by 4 high quality microphones.    \nMultimedia: The device supports a wide variety of audio and video formats and supports signing with Xbox login. Audio quality is great and there is no deterioration in quality when headphones are plugged in.    \nBattery: Battery is non removable and can be replaced only in service centre. However it provides enough juice to last a day. Battery backup has improved by around 10-15% with Lumia Denim update. Device can be charged both with the charger as well as by wireless charging plate. Wireless charging plate or Fatboy charging pillow doesn't come with the packaging unlike the UK version and has to be purchased separately and they are currently expensive.   \nPackaging and summing up: The packaging was very tiny and it was only twice as large as the phone in overall size. It comes with a tiny user guide and headset, adapter plug, USB cable which doubles up as the adapter cord as well as for connecting to the PC. Indian packaging are also beginning to look sparse like US ones. Shopping experience was great. My first Lumia 930 was cancelled by Flipkart since it was despatched by Delhivery and it was damaged in transit however Flipkart was generous enough to ship it on 21/03/2015 by E-Kart and I received on the 3rd day.    \nThe Lumia 930 is my first Windows Phone and after using it for 2 weeks it seems that if Microsoft continues to develop the OS, there is very less chance of me returning to Google's Android. The device is fabulous and the Nokia build quality is so reassuring. Highly recommended to all potential buyers out there.

No words to describe the phone. Most of the reviews mentioned its bulky proportions however to my pleasant surprise its not bulky at all. Very very sleek and amazing looking phone. I found it to be even better than iPhone 6 which costs double the price of Lumia 930. Display is just spell bounding.... best camera ..no other phone comes even close..after Denim update even 4k video is possible.    \nWireless charging is a highly underappreciated feature. I bought wireless charging plate also from flipkart for 1500 MRP 3999.... I couldn't believe how convenient this feature is. Also, wireless charging plate charges my phone at double the speed of a regular charger.  \nI love windows phone 8.1...I find it better than Android and IOS (used IPhone for 2 years). I would recommend ppl to move away from heard mentality and try windows phone. Its lovely...now forthcoming windows phone 10 would make it even better.  \nIn short best smartphone that punches way above its weight...and the price makes it the bargain of the century...even 5 star is not doing justice to Lumia 930...highly recommend this phone.

They have really thought about the user experience and multi tasking functionalities while coming up with this one. \nScreen locks and unlocks with flip cover movement (for slide lock). for other locking modes, the screen lights up on opening, and on closing shows the digital clock on black screen through window. This is a great feature. Not sure if it is magnetic, but works like one.   \nCons: \nNo OTG cable. However OTG is supported \nPhone is heavy. if you speak a lot with the phone, you will feel the weight. definitely lot heavier than my nokia 5230. \nWhite color can be a dust magnet. dont know for sure. will have to wait for few months to find out. however it looks super awesome as of now. \nScreen is a finger print magnet. so dont bother wiping it if you see finger prints on it. they will reappear the moment you touch the screen.   \nVerdict: if you want a good phone with large form factor and &lt; 14K, this is the one to pick. Panasonic is a trusted Japanese brand. That talks a lot about their phone quality, features, customer support, experience, etc, etc.   \nIf you want a small compact phone for little delicate hands, look elsewhere.   \nUpdate: It has been a couple of weeks since i am using this phone. Here are some more Pros and Cons: \nPros:  \n1. the applications run smoothly without lags. \n2. White cover is good quality and does not attract dust. it is clean and white as the first day even now. \n3. Good Battery backup. lasts 2-3 days with moderate usage combining calls and Internet. \n4. Camera is average. \n5. Phone is Definitely Owner's Pride.   \nCons: \n1. Cannot configure Wifi and Mobile data access for each app. That would have been great. Xolo Q2500 has this feature. \n2. Wifi reception is average. Does not work well from another room. \n3. Speaker volume is ok but not too loud, however the quality of audio is good. \n4. Phone UI sometimes gets stuck in the morning when it switches on and plays the alarm. had a tough time first day disabling the alarm, but works well now.

"], ["Dipanjan Banerjee", "The ideal culmination of the smaller iPhones &amp; the larger iPads ", "\n I am a big guy with big hands so buying a super sized smartphone was a no brainer for me. Hence, it goes without saying that I have been an Android user since stone age! I won't go into the usual boring stuffs of megapixels, ppi, number of cores, how much ram or that age old battle of iOS vs Android. My views are completely based on using the phone since a month as my daily driver. I have always believed that in terms of design &amp; choice of materials, Apple is second to none. The touch &amp; feel of the anodised aluminium can't be described with mere words. But there's a flip side to it of being extremely slippery. I haven't seen a smartphone display with such accurate colours &amp; such insane amount of brightness output which gives it a huge boon for sunlight legibility. Apple has been known for creating industry leading smartphone cameras and I was mighty impressed with the focussing power, low light image quality &amp; the ability to snap great looking photos consistently. Now, if there's one thing that I was completely blown away was the performance. It is so buttery smooth. I have played some of the most graphic intensive games like Modern Combat 5, Asphalt 8, Max Payne, etc and that too, around 2 hours straight on many occasions &amp; i didn't encounter a single frame drop or lag or heating issues. I used to hear about it but only after having experienced it myself that I agree that gaming is literally on a different level altogether on iOS. Coming to battery life, even for a heavy user like me, there hasn't been a single day where I have been able to discharge the battery completely. But what's even better is the unreal standby time. I go to sleep with around 20% charge and wake up after 7-8 hours with 19% charge still left!  \nP.S. - The price disparity between Apple products in India &amp; a country like USA is just plain jane stupid. 71k on a phone which you will be using for not more than 2 years is just too much no matter how great the phone is. All those issues regarding the bend-gate was way too much blown out of proportion.

Camera is a drawback,no flash and low light settings work only upto 40% or less.There is no autofocus or much manual settings \n4. Don't expect an IPS LCD or AMOLED for this price!!!! They also need to make profit.They have to cut down expenses to make this product of great quality, but cheap. \n5. Design is brilliant!!! \n6. Cut outs during calls may be due to your service provider (check your signal strangth) or issues with software conflicts.Try resetting your phone and installing ram boosters like nq android booster.Try keeping your phone maximum clean by removing unwanted apps and stopping unwanted background tasks.Also use a simple homescreen. \n7. Battery backup is actually excellent.You dont realize it.Use battery boosters to see the difference.Turn off bt,wifi,mobile data and background tasks while not in need, and dont keep the phone in a closed room or shelf.Do not overheat it too. \n8. There is no problem with the touch. \n9. Front camera is okay for VGA resolution,but can be better in better lighting conditions. \n10. Dont worry about 512 MB RAM.It can run most games and apps.Use nq android booster,cache cleaner and close unwanted task,background process and clean cache.It can clean up a lot of memory. \n11. The 1 GHz processor works faster than others like one in moto e(1.2 GHz). \n12. Graphics is very good.GREAT quality of texture rendering and performance. \n13. This is not an expert point,but it is fun gaming in this device. \n14. 4 inch display isn't bad.It's the best for daily use.Size of the device is small and thus can be held in our hands easily and comfortable. \n15. Internal memory is 4 gb which is good.You can alwayss use an SD card. \n16.

Available in the same 3 colours of black, white &amp; gold .    \nRight from the start when you hold the phone, the look &amp; feel definitely suffer if you try to compare it to its big brother G3 which is flagship &amp; premium. The grip is still good thanks to the textured back but then this one is plastic &amp; doesn't feel premium .It's less than half the price of the G3 so you can't expect much .The thin bezel definitely makes the screen look bigger &amp; adds to the aesthetics of the phone. Power &amp; volume rockers (can be used to click pictures) are the only buttons which are at the back similar to the G3. The phone weighs in at around 163 gms.  \nThe stylus is a good addition but there's no real use or specific apps which make it mandatory, could've just made the phone without it. Can be used though if you want to take quick notes. It's nothing like the pressure sensitive S Pen, just a basic stylus with a rubber tip.  \nThe display is 5.5&quot; qHD with a lowly resolution of 960x540 @ 200 ppi but you won't notice any issues with the display in terms of colours , contrast if you hold it without this knowledge. It still looks great &amp; definitely no corning gorilla glass here !  \nIn terms of specs, it's a quad core Mediatek MT6582 @ 1.3 Ghz &amp; Mali-400MP2 GPU. 1GB RAM &amp; 8GB internal memory with an expandable option of up to 32GB via a Mico SD slot.

Apps can work on dual window mode which can help you do your work more efficiently &amp; is a win-win feature.    \nComing to the camera bit , the rear one snaps at 13MP @ 4128x3096 with autofocus &amp; LED flash , comes out great in daylight esp . Geo tagging, touch focus &amp; panorama are other added features. Video shooting @1080p with 30fps is also good quality . Most disappointing bit is the 1.3MP front cam which is outright disastrous ! Cheaper budget phones click better pictures using the front cam. This is where it's competitor HTC Desire 816G comes out on top with a 5MP front cam @1080p &amp; at a lower price point as well .    \nDual SIM with 4G support is great for making it future proof &amp; Android updates are sure to reach this device.

Here are it's pros and cons..PROS...1, 3.5inch IPS screen with great clarity and colour reproduction..2, Touch response is very good..3, Primary camera which is 3MP takes descent pictures..4, Battery backup is nice, it lasts for two days on full charge, eventhough it has got only 1300maH battery..5, Android Os is latest JellyBean..6, 1.3ghz processor is very fast..7, Apps can be installed to SD card, so the problem of low internal memory is solved..8, Sound quality is awesome, eventhough treble is getting over bass..9, Games such as Subway surfer, Riptide GP, Raging thunder etc..works without lag....About cons, we can't argue it because at the price point of 4K, we can't expect a smartphone without these cons....Cons...1, Secondary camera is very poor, it seems like it is an Ambient Light sensor, only senses light..2, The flash is just a gimmick to show off, no use with it..3, Software updates are not available..4, Face detection doesn't work well..5, It faces some lag when we slide through apps &amp; widgets..6, It is not 3G..7, Only 256 MB ram, but it is justifiable at this price..8, No proximity sensor...If you need a descent Smartphone under these specs, ...Go For It...!!8-) "], ["Karthikeyan S", "A1 ", "\n No memory space in phone   \nAdditional memory card required   \nlow budget phone   \ngood touch   \nAndroid 4.2   \nQuick delivery by WS Retail "], ["Vinay Kumar", "Good features ", "\n It is a very good mobile with nice looks and Jelly Bean version.

Indian companies like Micromax or Karbonn could not produce such supreme quality n durable hardware until now, yes Xolo is slightly okay compared to other Indian competitors, but Gionee is above all of them and goes toe to toe with Apple or Samsung in terms of hardware quality.   \nGionee is a Chinese brand, but its an authentic Chinese brand that ensures devices are produced in high-end factory with over 8000 employees who consistently monitor quality of each device while its produced.

In my experience its not even water resistant. Even sony isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure what it is.    \nThe website claims it to be &quot;Waterproof&quot; under the condition that    \n&quot;all ports and attached covers are firmly closed; you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take the phone deeper than 1.5 m of water and for longer than 30 minutes; and the water should be fresh water&quot;   \nBut the authorized service center guys and the customer care claim it to be &quot;Water resistent&quot; and refrain from even using the word &quot;waterproof&quot;.   \nI had purchased an Xperia Z3 on jan 2015. On June 25th, I was travelling back from my office. It started raining heavily. The phone was in my pocket and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother to keep it in my bag as it was said to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cWaterproof under 1 meter water for 30 minute, if all the ports are closed properly). I made sure that the ports are closed.After reaching home in about 15 - 20 mins, I found out that it was not working.    \n I went to the sony service on sat (June 27th) and they said that the phone was water damaged and they do not entertain such cases under warranty. They started telling me that I will have to get it repaired outside of warranty for a nominal charge of Rs. 30,000 (when the phone cost is only 40K). I explained them that I followed all the instuctions (Such as closing all the port's cover and making sure that the phone is not under 1 meter of water) under which you guerentee the phone to be waterproof. Now the cover won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t open itself when it is inside my pocket and unless its flodding,which was not the case, the phone wont be under 1 meter just by rain water. For this they said that an electronic product can never be waterproof, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is just a marketing gimmick\u00e2\u0080\u009d. They kept showing me a litmus paper benath the ports which has turned red as water has entered the phone. I tried explaining them that I understand that water has entered the device but my question is how?   \nIf water has entered the phone despite all the coveres being closed, then the only possible reason could be that the port's cover are loose in fitting which is a manufacturing flaw, or a faulty design. Whatever it is, I am not responsible for it. If this device can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even sustain rain water while inside pocket, how can it be waterproof or even water resistant for that matter.   \nI had no luck at the service center, so I called up the customer care, who surprisingly are very rude, and they asked me to write a mail to the sony service head at Hyderabad. I did that on 30th June. Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t receive any reply from them. So I again sent the mail, this time to a different address. I got a prompt reply from their executives within 48 hours. They had asked me to bring my phone to the service centre for check up. All the service centre did was take some snaps of the phone and checked the covers and pronounce them to be intact. After 15 days, I get a reply from sony saying me \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe cannot cover your product under warranty as it has been water damaged and water has entered the device\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Which brings the entire episode to chapter 1.   \nThe thing that they explained me after 18 days of examination, I knew it the very hour. It preety simple that if a phone is damaged, after getting exposed to water, then water has entered inside it. The big question is HOW??    \nMy question to sony was how did it get damaged,   \nDid I break the device somehow so that the water leaked in (My fault)   \nDid the ports open up on itself because of a physical damage (My fault)   \nIf no physical damage is there and the port opens up on itself (Designer fault)   \nIf everything is fine and still water enters the device (Sony\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manufacturing defect)   \nI never dropped my phone under 1m of water for 30 mins while purchasing the phone (I should have done that) because if it were a manufacturing defect then we would have known it at that instant.   \nI would also like to ask sony what is the IP rating of this device, because in all the mail communications that I have received you guys have mentioned it as IP 55/58, whereas in your website I can see it as IP 65/68.

I recently bought a XOLO PLAY 8X 1200 mobile phone from a mobile dealer at Borivali on 3/10/14. The sole reason why I bought a Xolo mobile phone was because the company in promotion of this particular mobile handset had stated that it had a Octacore processor, and that its other features were far superior in comparison to mobiles in similar segment. The company however conveniently concealed that none of these features functioned effectively within anatomy of their mobile phones. On first time use the mobile started displaying issues such as fast battery discharge, mobile being hung up, failure to run pre installed apps.... Since being put to use the handset would require long hours of battery charging however, once being fully charged the battery would exhaust within 2 - 3 hours. Also, there was an extensive heating problem when used continuously for more than 10-15 minutes. \nAs these issues arose within first week of use, I immediately contacted their service center. But to further aggravate my plight, their service executive stated that it would take about 30 - 45 days to rectify the defect and that the mobile was required to be sent to their only service and repair center in India at Noida.

", "\n Well, first of all I loved the way Big B held LG4 in that promotional pic on LG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s site. The class and elegance it showed in that pic, made me buy this phone.  \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t research about the phone at all, but Big B was one more factor for me to burn close to 50K on this phone.  \nAfter using this phone for a week, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if I have made the right decision. You will know why am saying this. Am not going to talk about all the good things about this phone, for that, LG has already created a damn good site. Go there and check out the specs, features, and amazing photos. Am going to talk about my real experience with this phone, so here it is: \n- Fluctuating Price: I have never seen the price of a product fluctuating even before it is officially launched. LG broke my perception about stable pricing. Even before G4 was officially launched, you could buy it from 45,000 to 50,000. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your bargaining skills that would fetch you a deal you want. This price variation is very scary. Imagine you buy this phone for 49,999 and your friend comes and tell you that s/he bought it for just 40K. Believe me you will feel bad! LG should have controlled the pricing of its phone at least before the official launch. Shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they? \n- Heat: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already very hot in most parts of India, buying this phone would only increase your body temperature. I used it for 30 minutes for Google maps and then I got a call, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep this phone on my ear. It was that HOT! Agreed, that you have got one of the better processor on board, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to use the most basic feature of this phone. After installing Temperature Guard app, I noticed that the battery temperature reached 46 degree Celsius. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to switch my off! On the other side, I believe it is LG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marketing strategy wherein they would want G4 customers to buy an LG AC ;). Why should I? \n- Battery: has no life! If you plan to use this phone for gaming, net surfing, chatting, and of course calling, then please keep the spare battery on charging \u00e2\u0080\u0093 always! This phone can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handle even 2-3 hours of usage. Today, I checked the amount of time it would take to charge the battery which was at 15% - it took 2 hours 15 minutes to charge it to 100%. Though the company claim 100% charge in 1 hour 10 minutes. Imagine your girlfriend wants to make a call using your fancy phone, but you tell her to wait because you want to change the battery. How many times have you replaced your phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battery? At least I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done that even once, but LG expects me to do that with G4. But again, why should I? \n- Performance: better processor, more onboard RAM, but is it really fast? I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just pretty much the same as my previous Sony Xperia Z Ultra. If you are looking for a really superfast phone, well, you might be disappointed.  \nOthers have already reported problematic touchscreen issue, so watch out for it as well.  \nWith all these issues already, I hope LG really resolves these issues and makes it a real flagship phone, not a fault-shipped phone!

", "\n Got this mobile from a retail store about 10 days back and boy what a mobile this is!!!  \nI'll give you an overview of what i am experiencing with this mobile.    \nDISPLAY :- It is one of the best. Its hard to take ur eyes off the screen. Colours are optimally saturated to make things vibrant (not too vibrant as in samsung). At max setting the display is bright and outdoor visibility wont be a problem. Add to this the slight curve and the compact 5.5inch form factor and u have got an awesome display in ur hands.  \nPERFORMANCE :- The Snapdragon 808 as LG claims, seems to be nicely optimised for this mobile. There have been no hiccups so far. The graphics processor could have been a bit powerful though. Nevertheless, it will very much suffice ur daily usage and the occasional gaming sessions.  \nUI :- This is one area where LG has evolved a lot. The UI is a lot smoother and it runs without any lags. LG hasnt compromised on the customisability. Bloatware is minimal and there are a few nice touches that will make using this mobile a lot easier (eg- smart cleaning, double tap to wake, dual window etc etc).    \nCAMERA :- This is perhaps the best smartphone camera available now. Needs no introduction. Its AWESOME. The camera UI is minimal without any unnecessary filters. Most of the times u will find that the Auto mode will suffice, but if u have a bit of photography knowledge, Manual mode is what u would love the most. Ability to adjust the White Balance (in Kelvin values), Shutter speed (from as low as 1/6000 to as high as 30secs), Iso (50-2700), Exposure and Focus is a boon for those who want the best shot possible. Add to this the the ability to save the image in RAW format and u perhaps cant go wrong with this camera. Most of the times people compare this camera to that of S6, but believe me this one is the clear winner. The S6 produces great shots no doubt, but in low light this is the camera u wud want. Daylight pictures are more or less same for both except the fact that S6 produces images that are a lot saturated and may apparently look better to the eye. Same goes for the front camera as well. At 8mp, this is one of the best selfie camera.  \n A few cons regarding the camera :-  \n 1. Video recording and audio capture is not the best. The aggressive OIS makes videos wobbly and audio capture is not that good. There is no 60fps 1080p mode which is a bummer. \n 2. The camera tends to over expose and sometimes u will find the background light to be blown out.  \n 3. Post processing is quite aggressive and occassionally u may note some artefacts(while u have zoomed in to the image).   \nBATTERY :- Despite the fact that this is a 2k display, i have so far always got a Screen on time of 4-4.5hrs, which is quite good. Moreover, the back is removable and u can easily swap the battery. LG is providing an extra battery and battery cradle charger for those who pre-order/buy the mobile before 15th june. The mobile supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0, but quick charger doesnt come out of the box. The provided charger (of 1.8Amps) charges a bit slow and it will take around 120-130mins for a full charge from 0% (provided u dont use the mobile during charging orelse charging rate will slow down even more).  \nPRICING :- 49990 has now become a standard price tag for flagships and this phone is no exception. But since S6 and i6 are now available for a much lower price, its going to be hard for LG to attract customers (although G4 variant launched in India is dual sim and LG is providing free 3 months screen replacement alongwith 1leather + 1plastic back cover). However, having used this mobile for quite some time now, i must say this smartphone is totally worth the price.    \nAll in all this a great phone and certainly one that i will suggest to people in hunt for a flagship. The cons are not deal-breakers and im sure u wont even think about those after a few days.     "], ["Dilip Rathore", "The LG G4 is a great smartphone ", "\n LG has stuck with Android features that long-time users have come to love, and built a great smartphone on top of it.    \nLG is sticking with a removable back cover and battery, and a microSD slot for expandable memory, these are fantastic features to have in any smartphone specially if you are a power user.  \nThe G4's 16MP camera is fantastic and one of the best in the business - it has an f/1.8 aperture, allowing more light to reach the sensor, which is helpful in low-light conditions. It also has an auto laser focus feature that uses infrared detection to determine the focusing distance.  \nAll in all a fantstic phone enriched with so many user friendly features that everyone will love and care to have.

It is one of the best phones in the market right now and with a launch price of 49k it is as good if not better than all flagships. \nSince you all can read about the specs im not going to be including them here, ill just tell you about the phone. \nThe LG OS is very simple and similar to stock android with minimal LG skinning and extremely smooth and lag free interface. \nthe new IPS LCD although not as vibrant and saturated as the super amoled displays, is excellent with increased brightness and very good outdoor visibility. Much better than the previous LG flagships. It delivers very accurate colours as good as a TV. \nThe camera is just breath taking, with details that burst at you and dont pixelate even on zooming in. The camera has a manual mode for all you budding photographers out there, with adjustment for all settings (white balance, focus, shutter speed,etc) \nIt will give you the best shots out there, and with its 1.8 ap lense(smaller number being better light capture) it captures vibrant and bright night shots also. \nThe front camera at 8mp is the best in its category with exact colour reproduction and amazing detail in your selfies as well, and several gestures and voice operands to click a selfie, making it easier to operate with one hand. \nThe only flaw would be the video recording which because of it OIS(optical image stabilization)along with laser auto-focus turns out weird sometimes with choppy and dizzy effects. But still not of bad quality as such with great audio recording quality, and this isnt a deal breaker for me since i anyways prefer clicking snaps. \nThe processor along with 3gb ram together give monster outputs and the 6 cores in no ways is slower than the 8 cores on the 810 snapdragon processor, atleast it isnt noticable with day to day heavy and medium usage. So basically it can handle all your heavy duty game and multitasking with several apps open with ease. \nThe removable back cover with removable battery and option for an sd card is an absolute treat with major flagships doing away with this much needed feature. \nThe battery is weak as with a quad HD display at 5.5 inch and having to push those large number of pixels is very battery draining, not to mention lollipop which although advertised to consume less battery still drains more due to its animations.It can get through a day of medium usage(surfing,texting,watsapp,fb,etc) with say about 6-8 hours on screen time. \nYou could keep a spare battery, but that isnt my cup of tea. \nSound output is decent and I personally dont like the back mounted speaker although audio output is clear without disturbance, just not so tactfully placed. \nThe phone is very beautiful with a large variety of options available for choices (plastic/steel mix, ceramic finish, and leather finish), the bezels (area surrounding the screen) are a little larger than the G3 although a slight curve completely makes you forget about the size difference which is anyways very small. \nThe back buttons work like a charm with different materials used for the volume rocker and power key. The index finger rests well on the buttons and once you get used to that, you'll find yourself looking for back buttons on all smart phones. The double tap to sleep and wake screen are a must for everyone as this does away with the usage of the power key almost completely and increases durability of the button as well \nConnectivity is great, what you'd expect from a flagship with negligent drops sometimes.   \nPersonally this is my favorite phone in the market now, although i give it a 4 star, due to the high pricing, choppy video playback(due to laser autofocus) and not upto the mark battery, otherwise its just too good to be true, and you have to try it to believe it!

So fellas Please dont go for Kitkat update. Fon becomes slow after update and shows some lags in games as well in some apps. While scrolling up and down you will feel the lags. And the worst part is you can never return back to jellybean. So my suggestion is never update to kitkat. \nSo conclusion is if you compare it with other chinese brands like Asus and Xiomi in terms of gaming performance It is far better than Asus but not better than Xiomi but remember it has 1 GB of RAM unlike the formers with 2GB. \nThe touch is nice but once in it miss the gesture sometimes like once in 50 times. \nI am facing another problem with it I have got some problem with charging system, coz it is showing 2h 40min to full charge and actually it is taking more than 4 hours to get fully charged.

Lack of bluetooth file transfer and inability to make 3G Video calls pinches a lot. Video calling over facetime thru internet is provided over wifi. It also says thru mobile network but yet to try.    \nHowever, its interface is as as smooth as hot knife in a butter brick.   \nMaps, Whatsapp, FB etc are really very smooth. Transferring your own song library to the devise thru itunes takes a lot of technical DIY-ness. Simpler in Android to just copy paste them in the drive/card/folder. Even in Windows Phone its very cumbersome to trasnfer music. Further your playlists should be made on PC. You can't add songs to playlist in WP (Laughable).   \nWhy this nano SIM business, I fail to understand, How much weight / space can you really reduce. ITs really cumbersome to prepare the SIM to fit and then its of no use in another phone, should you need to switch for any reason.   \nThe phone was a present to my wife and she's quite happy with her limited usage of social media which is excellent. The color &amp; rounded long slender shape went well with her. However, I will not buy an Iphone for myself till it allows Bluetooth file transfers, 3G Video Calling &amp; easy music &amp; file transfer from PC to Phone as lot of data travels in phone (what's the big deal?). IT appears Apple is purposefully giving lesser services then contemporay phones and adding bit by bit in every new addition.   \nFlipkart's offer of cashback with HDFC Card was excellent and with the receipt of cashback in my account, the price really came down to a sane level of 36500. Delivery was also quite fast. Excellent big bubble packing too.    "]], "title": "Apple iPhone 5C"}

Sounds is just too loud and not that soothing to the ears.   \nAlso after a year time now this phone lag a bit and gets restart but that normal.. \nOverall 4/5 "], ["AMIT BHAIK", "A BEAST in market ", "\n After almost an year of use I am writing this review.   \nBuild: The build quality is quite good. Sturdy design, slim and sleek. But the camera bulges out a bit.   \nHandling: THOUGH this beauty has 5.5 inches screen BUT as the borders are thin the area between screen and outer body is quite small. Yes you can easily slip the device in your pocket. But it is equally true that this is not a one handed device; neither are any other 5+ inch devices.    \nBattery: TRULY a BEAST. I really wonder how Gionee has managed to give such a great battery performance on a FULL HD device having 5.5 inches screen that too using a mere 2500 mAH battery. I charge the device upto 100% at 11PM. With 3G and WiFi always on, screen brightness set to AUTO, using youtube, facebook, whatsapp, normal web browsing throughout next day and when I reach home at around 9PM the battery is 65-70%. Charges up pretty quickly - at the rate of 1% per minute.   \nDisplay: You will fall in love with this display; unless you take a look at any device having triluminious display (Sony). Yes it is a bitter truth that Sony's triluminious display is better than Gionee E7's LTPS JDI display. But still no worries, the display is quite good; even when viewed in sunlight. Viewing angles are truly exceptional. Good enough to watch movies.   \nUser Interface: The inbuilt amigo user interface is just a crap but no worries play store has more than 3000 launchers and yes Google Now launcher did that spark in UI I was looking for in my mobile.   \nPerformance: Boasted with huge 3GB RAM and an outstanding processor. AnTuTu benchmark score was 40463, just below HTC One M8t and Samsung Galaxy S5.    \nSound: The sound output of the device is Ok-ok. When you play any music track, you also get options to adjust the bass, which I loved the most. You will love to hear music from this device.   \nCall Quality: Call quality is good enough. The only problem is that sometimes the phone loses the network even when there is full coverage. This happens, but rarely.   \nAccessories: Yes this phone came with THREE beautiful pieces of NFC tags, average quality earphones, a stand to place the phone while watching movies, a charger, and a Flip Cover.   \nCamera: Simply OUTSTANDING. Lets take the 16MP back cam first. You can't get a better camera performance in any other device (The ONLY Exception: Lumia 1020's 41 MP camera where sensor size is 1/1.5 inch) In E7 the sensor size is 1/2.3 inch which is the size found in all Point and Shoot / Advanced Point and Shoot Digital Cameras (All other smartphones use about 1/3 inch sensor size which is pretty small as compared to this device's 1/2.3 ). It is equipped with 5 element scratch resistant Sapphire lens from the Largan M8 solution which does its job exceptionally well. The flash being LED is good enough but not the best. HDR feature works just GREAT. Just have some pics in HDR and you would be surprised to see how the camera manages to take such beauty pictures EVEN IN LOW LIGHT WITHOUT FLASH. There are two modes you can use - Simple and Professional. Professional mode allows you to take more control over the settings. Low light performance is very good - thanks to the sensor size which can accumulate more light. Previously during night photography the device didn't focus during complete darkness but Eureka... They fixed this issue in 4.4 KitKat upgrade. Daylight performance - 1080x1920 resolution would fall insufficient to gather the picture clarity - Such great is the picture clarity. Macro performace is very very good. You will be confused whether the macro pic is taken from E7 or a DSLR. The background gets OPTICALLY BLURRED and the pics look just crisp and clear. Front 8MP cam has autofocus and it really works great. Very good if you like to take selfies. People sometimes get confused whether the pic is taken from front cam or back cam.   \nBrand: GIONEE - a brand name which didn't flow in your ears so frequently as sony and samsung. But just think of the components used in it. All the components used (e.g. Snapdragon processor, Adreno graphics) are the same that are provided in high end sony and samsung devices costing 10k more. GIONEE is just taking those, assembling them into a phone and providing you with a tagname of GIONEE. So just look up for a service centre in your city, if it is there you can blindly buy their products.   \nDrawbacks: Every coin has two sides and so has your E7. Brand is GIONEE - unless a mobile geek the other person would not recognize your mobile. There is JUST a minute lag at some times; but very rarely. Sometimes the phone will go into deep sleep.   \nUpdates : You are NOT likely to get updates for this mobile. Btw it just got updates to Android 4.4 KitKat on March 2015. You shall be satisfied with it.    \nConclusion: You have huge number of positives in the bucket so just relax and have trust on your &quot;Gionee Elife E7 - Made for Shooting&quot; -- Double Thumbs Up for this BEAUTY...

"], ["Prasanna Iyer", "Gionee is all about hardware. ", "\n Most of the times, the usual Indian Perception goes for following things: \n=&gt; Body (looks) \n=&gt; Powerful Processor \n=&gt; Nice good Rear camera. (Usually we look at the MPs and focal length) \n=&gt; Front Camera (Selfie Freaks) \n=&gt; Services   \nThese are the things which marketing guys sitting in Gionee make sure they end up with convincing facts with interesting images.    \nWhat we do not really look at: \n=&gt; Hidden Clauses \n=&gt; Hardware - Software Compatibility  \n=&gt; Software Upgrades \n=&gt; Developer support across forums (eg XDA) \n=&gt; Accessories Availability   \nLet me tell you about the second section, since the marketing guys have already given you the first part.  \n1. Hidden Clauses. Eg Your warranty is void if you use any other Micro USB charger except Gionee. Why? Because Gionee Service Center says that Gionee's phone is compatible with only and only Gionee Chargers. Second, Every time you have to even slighly open the panel for even the smallest of things (eg charger port check), they say there will be a data loss. Third, unlike other companies' service centers, they do not touch Gionee Elife E7 on spot. Even for a small fix, they will be sending your phone for 15+ days. That's ridiculous! Fourth, You need to show your OWNER BILL to buy even a single accessory from Gionee Service Center (Confirmed with Service Centers in Gurgaon). I asked, How does it matter whether my device is in warranty or not when I am buying a charging cable? They said &quot;Sir, rules are rules!&quot; \n2. Hardware Software Compatibility. Eg. Most of the 3rd party applications which run consistently in background (which you want to ofcourse) for eg. Truecaller won't work properly. The inbuilt task killer keeps freeing memory by removing the apps from background. Hardware wise it is a beast but not when it comes to the software which supports the hardware. They need to do some serious work on making sure that they stand to the mark. And after using elife e7 5 months and numerous attempts to contact the tech team to give feedback and troubleshooting, I am fed up. The attempts are futile. \n3. Software Upgrades \nOh well, world is going towards lollipop. And they are giving us one and asking us to wait to be in stone age technology. Initially I could accept that it takes few months after release of the android version for phone companies to upgrade to their devices. But not when world is moving two versions ahead! \n4. Developer support across forums (eg XDA) \nIf you know what is rooting, here is something for you... The CWM is chinese! That's the only one available. Even if you end up finding a translated binary for the same, no point at all. Why? No Custom ROMs. Why? No Developers to work on. Why? Gionee doesn't release its kernel source to the world! Why? God knows! \n5. Accessories Availability \nAs I said before, I cannot keep a physical copy of bill wherever I am carrying this phone. It might be fine for many but not me. I cannot show a bill every time I have to buy a small accessory from Gionee. And why is there no identification from IMEI number that whether a device is under warranty or not?  \nAlso, you can only find Pudini as the only company providing cases. No Hybrid cases, no TPU cases.   \nIts your take friends. I am done with this phone. Appreciate Gionee for their amazing hardware boom but feel sorry for them for software and product as a whole aspects and as well as for me for choosing this.    \nSigning off!

"], ["Rohan Suryawanshi", "Mixed Views ", "\n Hi,   \nHad purchased this Awesome device on June 10, 2014 and the delivery was bang on!!! After using the device for a week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time I take this opportunity to comment on the device functioning.   \nI am an existing Samsung user (Note II) and wanted a dual sim phone as secondary device with good battery life (minimum 3000 mAh), tried exploring many devices and shortlisted this device taking well into consideration that this device is with Marvell chipset and not Mediatek (unlike used in brands like Micromax, Karbonn, Sony, etc.) following are my views on the device.   \n1) The device appearance is excellent, gives a premium feeling. The device size is 6 inches and one needs to get hands on which happens within few days. \n2) The display clarity is good and video watching is a pleasure on the device. \n3) Battery life is very good, it gave me almost 48 hours of battery back on 2G and 24 hours on 3G. \n4) The camera is decent in day light and below average during night. (although I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used it much as already have a better MP phone with me) \n5) The usable storage is around 12 GB out of 16 GB which is quite impressive. \n6) The RAM usage is also quite less with applications installed it is always around 500 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 600 MB consumed, which is quite impressive than my existing Samsung Note II which is always around 1. 7 GB occupied)    \nHere comes the problematic part of the device. \n1) When 3G sim is inserted, the device tend to lose connectivity on both the sim cards and you are left with no option but to restart the phone and only then the network resumes back. This happened quite often for me around 3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 4 times in a single day which is more annoying. The device works fine with 2G sim, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no need for restarting the phone. \n2) When you receive voice call, the device loses Data connectivity irrespective of either the sim cards and only resumes once the call gets disconnected. \n3) I had installed Truecaller (to avoid receiving unnecessary calls) but the application never opened in the device, neither before the call nor after the call which is disappointing. (tried reinstalling the software but with no positive result)   \nI had no option but to return the device as the intention of purchasing the device was defeated and the hunt for new device has already started for me.   \nIf the above problems faced by me are not a hassle then the device is worth buying.   \nHope this review helps in taking a right decision before purchasing this device.   \nCheers !!!   \nRohan    "], ["Sailesh Kumar TVS", "Worst Smartphone! ", "\n Purchased this phone about 2 months ago, and since then have been visiting the service centre every fortnight. The network quality sucks, and service connection keeps dropping therefore needing you to reboot the phone regularly to make it work. Service Team has no solution yet, and there are more users complaining about the same each day. Also, phone has dual-front speakers but the output is lower than a smartphone carrying a single speaker. Unfortunately, cannot advise anyone to choose this considering the unresolved network issues with the phone which HP too doesn't seem to know the reason! "]], "title": "HP Slate 6"}

", "\n I recently bought this phone and the experience is pretty much amazing. This phone has got everything one is gonna need, the apps in the windows store are sufficient too. It never lags, has a beautiful UI and the best part is that its from Nokia, the brand which is reliable. The camera although is not the best but the photos taken from it can easily beat those phones with 8 mp camera. The HD display looks just great and the battery is powerful too. If you are looking for a great phablet then nothing is better than this in this price segment "], ["Trambak Ray", "The brother of small range phablets ", "\n I din't buy this from flipkart but well i'm so impressed by this monster that i have to give a review!   \nSize: Huge! But also easily fits in hand unlike the overpriced galaxy mega.   \nBuild quality: Great! Plastic, not good but not bad even. And most important, it doesn't slip easily.   \nScreen: Forget other screen features..its got Corning Gorilla Glass 3! what more can you hope for? Have long fingernails? have a cat? go on and scratch the screen...not a single line! \nAnd the display otherwise is beautiful. This phone doesn't require a screen guard but if you think that using a guard can disturb the quality of movies, then well don't think and use a guard..no difference in quality i tell you!   \nBattery: Awesome!I played asphalt 8, used all apps possible, took 10-15 pictures and watched HD You tube videos...and the battery after two days: 50%!   \nCamera: Not as expected. I expected an 8 MP camera but it comes with a 5MP one but hold on! though it's just 5, it's quality is just fine! not a problem. But those who are camera freaks, don't buy this phone. Also those who are selfie freaks, don't buy because the secondary camera is just VGA. But good enough for skype calls!   \nPerformance: Unbelievable! When i bought this, i had doubts that this phonw cannot run high-end games and apps but the phone slapped me on my face! every single game and app runs smoothly! with a 1.7Ghz dual core qualcomm spnapdragon processor and 1 GB ram, everything is just brilliant! Awestruck!   \nStorage: At first disappointed but after some time no problem. Wanna know why? I'll explain. You get a storage of 8GB out of which system uses 2.5GB and other applications with 1.5GB so you get approx 4GB. a bit low, eh? yes. But hold on! this phone has a memory slot..upto 64GB but you cant move apps and games. Now you must be thinking why did i tell you to hold on just to disappoint? No! i told you to hold on because of windows phone 8.1! WP8.1 will come with ability to move apps and games to sd, so buy it and wait till june for moving apps, after that, all smiles! :-)   \nSpeaker: Flawless, even when hearing music on speaker, you won't be disappointed.   \nTouch: Super sensitive, no problem at all.   \nOverall: 3.5/5 points deducted for camera and storage(until WP 8.1) But I do recommend you to buy it and after WP 8.1 Update, just use this phone...Ye to Samsung Ka BAAP Hai!!! :p :-)   \nBuy it!

And the 15.24cm screen with the 720p HD resolution display and True colour and the Nokia Clear Black technology brings an altogether different angle to it. Even the videos and the images look spectacular on the big screen. The slim body and the matte coloured back panel form the exterior of my Nokia Lumia 1320 which I am pretty proud of. I can boast of a number of features on my Nokia Lumia 1320 like its office applications, photography app, navigation app etc. The Office apps are of special importance to me since I need them too often. They include the Windows Phone 8 powered MS Office, MS Exchange, Office 365 and the Lync. Of the photography apps I find the Storyteller app to be the most interesting as it shares my story on the big screen by arranging my images, videos and Cinemagraphs on the interactive HERE Maps.

And I need not have to worry about the security provided by the Microsoft at all. I can even carry my documents around with the 7GB free cloud space which can store documents, files etc. One major problem that I used to face while accessing internet on my previous handset was slow connectivity. But on my Nokia Lumia 1320, I have 3g connectivity enabled and hence I no longer get stuck while surfing the net or wait for hours to download. Its 15.24 cm screen with a 720p HD resolution ensure that my experience with video games and other images and videos are amazing. Infact the large screen in the front with the colourful covering along with its slim and curvy design make it the perfectly good looking phone that I can flaunt. The Nokia Story teller app is one of the many apps on my phone but stands out because of its creativity in reviving my memories in a unique manner.  \nA Fully Loaded Device "]], "title": "Nokia Lumia 1320"}
