Look, copy of Lumia to give you the feel of it. 3. SAR value is very low when compared to other basic phones. 4. Multiple alarms. 5. Bright colorful themes. 6. The dialed button has the option for all the Recent Dialed, Received and Missed, this feature is not present in most of previous Nokia basic model phones. 7. And most importantly &#34;Rapid Rolling&#34; baby, oh yeah!!!! 8. Pro for me, as Vibration is very much high, and much needed if you are travelling and spend most of the hours outside. 9.

The 2 negative feature which I found was one has to select the SIM from which one has to make calls using # key 1st and then dial. The Phone after dialing the No does not ask u to choose the SIM like Nokia 130 Dual SIM. For Example MTNL SIM will used for MTNL/BSNL Calls & Vodafone SIM for Private operator calls. Also the phone does not have a Auto power switch on/off feature where it will switch on automatically in the morning and switch off at night.  If one is sufficient with basic things in life and follows the policy of less is more then this is the best Dual SIM Phone in the market to make and receive calls and send Text SMS.

(read the review to understand that better)", "Mahesh R S", "This is hands down THE BEST MOBILE PHONE I have ever owned in my life!  Over the past 3 years I have owned about 20 low and mid-range Android phones from various brands (Samsung, Lenovo, MMX, Sony, HTC). Android phones always have their frustrations mainly because they are &#34;pre-loaded&#34; with a boat-load of useless software. And because of Android's stupid design, you cannot get rid of that bloat-ware if you cannot root your phone. Add to that the fact that 3g NEVER works in India, at least for me. In fact, I broke most of my phones out of pure rage with non-working 3G connections, or some unwanted bloat-ware starting up unexpectedly/suddenly and doing unexpected &#34;bloat-ware-ly&#34; things.  In the &#34;simple-phone&#34; category, I have owned quite a few Nokia phones ... but frankly I had always hated them. Nokia was also in the habit of loading its phones with useless crap-ware. And most of the Nokia phone designs were pathetic.  So, when I was looking for a simple, easy to use phone, with discrete buttons, for my mom, I happened to find this. I bought the first piece for myself and a second piece for my mom. Within moments of getting my phone I fell in love with it. It is light-weight. It is small, but handy. There's no useless software on this phone. There's no &#34;Internet&#34; access on this phone. This is just what a mobile phone should be in India: a way to make/receive calls, a way to receive text-message updates from your friends and banks, and a way to send an occasional text message. If you need other things like Internet access, Internet/web based messaging, social networking, etc, in our 3rd world country then you better have access to a high speed connection and a tablet.  So, this phone has all the features I would want from a simple phone. In fact, this has become my primary phone. All of my still surviving Android phones have become &#34;tablets&#34; that connect to some wifi network. I am off 3g for now and hopefully for ever!"], ["5.0", "A Value for Money Communication & Entertainment Device", "Zaysen", "Purchased it on 09-Feb-2015. Have used it for 2 months. Listed are the pros & cons !  Cons: 1-No File Manager/browser Option like Chinese GSM Phones. 2-No Image Viewer and background wallpaper change via Micro Sd Card. 3-No internal battery so each time the clock has to be reset if the battery is removed. 4-Battery has to be removed every time one changes/removes SIM & Micro SD Card.  Pros: 1-Excellent Build Quality Made In Vietnam, 2-Excellent Call quality, Phone will accept only Normal GSM Mini SIM's not micro SIM's so no backward compatibility with smart phones. 3-FM Radio and Micro SD Card work even without SIM Cards which is very good. 4-Upon Auto scan FM Radio scanned and saved all FM channels in NCR Region with their names also. 5-FM Radio needs headphones[In the box normal 3.5mm] to be plugged or else it will not work even in background. 6-Music player automatically detects the MP3 files in SD Card and makes a list.Sound quality is very very goody. From the MP3 files detected one can customize & set ring & SMS tones of both SIM cards individually. This feature is the most important as built in tones are archaic. 7-Same with the Video Player. The Video Player scans and makes a list of all video files & plays Only MP4[MPEG-4] & AVI Files even heavy movie files of 500mb. But once the video starts there is no way to jump the video forward or backward and play from where one wants, only pause and stop, and then it starts from the beginning. 8-The phone easily detected a 32 Gb Sandisk Micro SD Card. 9-No Camera which is a relief for people like me. 10-Battery can easily play 3 movies of 1.50 hrs with half charge remaining. From Zero to full battery takes 3 hours to charge. 11-Bluetooth is very fast and can receive 20mb files in &#62;10 minutes. 12-If connected to the PC via a Micro USB Cable[Not in the Box] SD Card gets detected in no time and files can be transferred effortlessly and phone can also be charged via the USB. 13-Has other useful features like torch,scheduler,calculator,alarm but no scheduler for auto power on/off for the phone.  Verdict & for whom this phone is meant !  So for those people who like a slim easy to carry phone in pocket with maximum battery life, & who do not expect much from things and follow the policy of less/bare minimum is enough, peace of mind factor of spares and after sales service,good build quality, Nokia 130 is a very good buy.  Only minuses are a lack of image viewer & background wallpaper customization which is available in a Rs 500 Richmax Svelte 15 Chinese Phone. Also my view is that if mp3 & mp4 files are regularly played the battery will be dead in 6 months as the BL-5C Battery is not meant for such heavy usage. If mp3 & mp4 playing is one's concern buy a better handset with higher mAh battery like chinese models."], ["4.0", "worth of buying", "balamurugan", "I bought this phone for my father....who does not want a humongous screened touch mobiles.....he said just want a phone to speak.....it suits well.....he is not having any trouble still now with this phone..except the keypad....its too small....the Centre accept button and arrow keys are not well separated...its hard to press the Centre....while pressing any of the arrow keys is pressed......other than this everything is fine....u can't change wall papers.....it is of default style....overall for a mobile without any cosmetic features who just need it for speaking can go for this....!!!!"], ["5.0", "Amazon the best way for Shopping Online", "Sanju Singh", "Good loudspeaker, dualism mobile phone, equipped with torch also in back side, overall in a low cost best deal...amazon really gives best rates in all the products...

This model fails this assumption. It is an improvement only in some aspects from iball aasaan1 and a downgrade in some aspects.  My father used asaan 1 for over four years and the phone stopped charging recently stating ' bad contact of charger' the iball service centre could not repair the phone. I wanted a repair as this is the phone my father was used to. So, like all enthusiastic unwise youngster, I bought iball asaan 2, thinking that it would be similar in use and better than iball asaan 1. I also bought a philips xenium for a comparison.  i ball asaan 1 recited the number of the number key pressed - you press 1, and the speaker says one; this way the visually impaired can know the key they have pressed. iball asaan 1 also recited the time on the hour. These two features are absent in asasaan 2.  asaan 2 has a much longer battery life and a display that is better visible in daylight - as compared to asaan 1. The speaker of asaan 2 is very bad, the sound cracks, much inferior to asaan 1. asaan2 has a brighter torch than asaan 1. the camera and dual sim on asaan 2 are neither good nor necessary. asaan1 has a tedious message and text entry, asaan 2 is an improvement over it.  My father could not get used to the phone, and i have just bought another asaan1!  My take: If you are buying the phone for a senior citizen, go for philips xenium - i find it much better (bigger display, smoother software, brighter torch, good - well lit and distinct keys, great battery life; the phone is larger though). if the user is already used to asaan 1, go for an asaan1 (till stocks last) again as migration to asaan 2 may not be easy and asaan 2 has many weakpoints.

But of course why we need them. use dolphin browser to run YouTube flawlessly. any of the two sim cards in the slots can work 3g and the other will work 2g, just check the options. uninstall unnecessary inbuilt software. google maps, google search, google chrome, nokia here maps, es file explorer, opera, etc run very smooth. the design of the back cover is really good, you won't need any flap cover or back cover, just screen guard if you wish. the Nokia x2 feels sturdy and stylish. since there was no swipe software for typing, I installed 'swiftkey' software and now I can type just by swiping, and it is pretty fast. this is last phone from Nokia as a company. if you have any query post it on amazon."], ["4.0", "Nice phone", "Mohit kumar", "Superb phone No hanging !"], ["5.0", "welcome nokia again !!!", "welcomd nokia again !!!", "its a unique piece from nokia android+windows..

Sound Leak", "desperadomar", "This phone which I bought from a local seller which has less rate than amazon. I bought this for using it as a basic phone. Since I am a fan of nokia 1100 which was rather good in its make and sound quality. With that in mind I bought this basic phone. And sadly to say this is one of the worst phone I have ever used. I think recent low end karbon phones show much quality than this piece. Even the make and keypad can be negotiated but the sound quality which we require most for a basic phone. This is an useless piece. The problem of this phone is  It has sound leak (Google it) ie, it has  an opening in the back side which is  for loud speaker and you can hear from the backside also most sound is leaked through it also it affects privacy. Also it causes a lot sound of the air which is rushed through this hole when you are traveling.  You have to push or press the headset towards the ear since the sound is leaked.  so when selecting a basic phone which we need the most (voice) is one of the worst feature of this phone.  So those who are buying this phone for calling purposes don't go for this. It not worth a single penny.  Note: when I checked the phones bought by my friends like 106, 105 all have got this issue. and I when I complained it to nokia. They said you can get  only a replacement of the product since it is not repairable. But when contacted the local seller he said this is not registered as a complaint. He said this problem you are saying is default for the phone and could not be replaced. Anyway I lost my money. Since I haven't bought the product from amazon please don't ignore this. minimum google the issue you will find that I am saying the truth.

I have got a chance to use the phone for a week and here's my review.I would try to keep it clean and simple.  &#10004;Design:A great looking phone for such a budget price.Even though the entire casing is plastic the build quality is pretty great.the front earpiece are metallic.The touch capacitive buttons are back-lit.The hands-on experience is pretty premium and it is light enough. &#10004;Display:4.7 IPS HD Display makes it a premium one at this price.The viewing angles may not be that great but is enough. And its perfect for single handed usage. &#10004;Camera:Its an other selling point of this device with 8MP+5MP camera pair. The 8MP backshooter really takes good shots with nice details.And the color reproduction is better than most in the same range. The back-illuminated sensor makes it capable of capturing excellent low light images.But make sure to keep the phone still, while low lightshots The front snapper can take great selfies. &#10004;Performance:Can run most of the high end games with ease.Tried playing temple run,real racing and some small games and it really handles it nicely. Haven't noticed any kind of heating.I also tried playing the GT-racing 2 with full graphics and the device struggle a bit while race beginning. &#10004;Battery:Good enough but not great.The low capacity battery can give you a pretty good battery backup for the budget price.[5000MAh power bank recommended.]  WILL UPDATE THIS AFTER MORE USAGE"], ["1.0", "Irresponsible servicing centre", "song hauzel", "Never buy a Karbonn mobile of any model.

It's as same as Nokia Lumia phones. 3) Lumia apps such as mix radio, Lumia camera rocks 4) Again touch feels fantastic and the screen is responsive as much as any phone. 5) As usual being a Windows Phone, there is no lag whatsoever. Feels fluid and fast. 6) Gorilla glass 3 : Important reason to consider this mobile from others. It's scratch resistant and sturdy. Well, many more are there. If you're looking for a fantastic smartphone experience at this range, look no further get the Lumia 535 and enjoy. Amazon did a fast delivery &#128522;. Will post about battery life in couple of days. Overall I'm fully satisfied with this device. Thank you Microsoft and Amazon. ;)  Update : The battery lasts easily for one day with moderate-heavy usage. You can easily take it for two days if you use your phone for calling and texting. Gaming does consume a bit of juice faster but it is expected at this price range.I wish the battery was 2000mAH but it's good as I said.Good thing is that you can play most of the games from the Store even the graphic intensive games like Asphalt 8. It doesn't lag and that's one more advantage of this phone. Again, I'm satisfied with this device :)  Update 2: I see many people saying that their screen getting magnified suddenly. That's not a bug but a feature in all the Lumia phones and is called \"Screen Magnifier\". To disable it, open settings>ease of access>Screen Magnifier, toggle it to off. You will be done. Also I installed the Windows Insider app and got Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2 which brings a improved Settings App, App permissions and double tap on the Navigation bar to sleep. It's running smoothly without any bugs, try updating to this version on your own risk and understand that it may even take you to Windows 10 TP directly. Here are some useful tips. 1) To make your battery last long, disable double tap to wake. 2) If you feel your Lumia Camera app takes around 2 seconds to load and you miss the best moment to click. Then you can use the default camera app which is not accessible in Lumia 535 from the app list. So to use it, open your Photos app>settings>Default Camera app, in that list select Microsoft Camera. Now open Settings>Notifications+actions, select the Camera in quick actions in any one of the four places. That's it, now you can open Microsoft Camera app using the quick action shortcut, even from the Lock Screen so that your camera is ready anytime for you :D Enjoy."], ["3.7", "Very good buy", "Abhinav R", "Got this for Rs.7130.

Was really excited with all the buzz in the market. And to my satisfaction the phone was awesome as expected. However after some days my front as well as the primary Camera started giving very poor quality pictures. I had visited oneplus service centre at Borivali, on 5-3-15 where I had demonstrated the camera problem to the technical person. The concerned person (naivita) had verified the problem and has issued me a job sheet dated 5-3-2015. The jobsheet is attached to this mail. The service centre informed me that the phone will have to be submitted and they will further transfer the phone to the Andheri service centre located at Marol. They further told me that the phone will be replaced and I will get my new phone after 15 days. I requested for a standby phone from the service centre since till 20 days I will be without phone, but they refused to give me any standby phone. Thereafter I communicated with the Andheri Service centre. I informed them about the camera malfunction and requested him to replace my phone as soon as possible because I have several clients call to be made and received daily. Without phone I will be handicapped and my work will suffer extremely. To my surprise, the person informed me that from last one month they have not received any consignments of new phone (from Oneplus Company) which can be replaced for faulty phones. He further informed that until they receive new phones, they cannot replace my phone by any means. If I order phone from Amazon I receive it within 2 days. And from your service centre I am receiving all the rubbish reply. Moreover, whenever I call at both of these service centre (Borivali and Andheri) the phones are either kept aside or they keeps on ringing indefinitely. This seems to be a very unsatisfactory and an unprofessional act from the company as well as the service centre peoples.

Will keep updating as required.  Without going too technical, here are my first impressions about the phone.  Packaging: This is THE best packaging I have seen done for any mobile phone with the obvious competition of Apple products. This is as good as how Apple packages their ipods, iphones etc. Detailing is given to every single piece of the box, the same detailing has also been given to every components inside the phone. Whats included in the package is mobile phone, data card (beautiful red one), SIM ejector tool and charger. No headphones, please buy one separately.  Looks: When I first opened the box, I was disappointed to look at the size of the phone. I looked huge. I am currently using Lumia 625 and Galaxy S Advance, compared to that this looked really big. Then when I took the phone in my hand, I was surprised to its weight. I was looking for a battery in the box because a phone of this size can't be so light. Eventually, I was sure that the battery is non-removable and already in the phone. Also, it is a big phone but the ergonomics are right, so using it is not a difficulty as with other large phones. The back looks quite different, sandstone back, reminds me of resin/emery paper used to rub the walls. It doesn't slip at all due to this.  Display: It has one of the most beautiful displays I have seen. I have AMOLED display in my S Advance but this display does not over do it, it's just perfect from every angle. I am in love with its display.  Customization: There is a tonne of customizations possible which I have not fully explored yet to be honest. You can make your phone look the way you want to. Apple restricts this a lot.  Camera: I have selected the photo size as 13M and I believe that's the setting for 13MP photos. it clicks awesome photos. Many a times the photo looks good in the phone but when you transfer it to an ipad or laptop and zoom it, it gets grainy. The photoshots from this mobile is just amazing. I am truly enjoying the capturing. I could read the texts very far away when I zoom it. Also, colors and saturation are just perfect. Has a decent front facing camera as well for skype or video calling, never tried though.  Battery: I must make a mention of this because this is one area I have never been satisfied except on my ipad. I just love this, it takes a while to charge (almost 2-3 hrs), but lasts almost 2 days on moderate usage (8-10 calls of 5-10mins duration, 30 mins of gaming per day, lots of browsing and 10 apps download per day, few youtube streaming).  Call quality: This was my one concern as I have tried few other phones earlier made in china where the call quality was not as good as a Nokia/iPhone/Samsung. But this mobile is just perfect. After all, the primary reason to buy phones is making calls, atleast for me :-)  SIM Card: It's not mentioned anywhere what kind of SIM is used in this phone.

Right from the packaging to the phone itself.. this proves how much money other companies make while selling so called flagship phones.. agreed that the advertising and R&D budgets push their cost but the 'ONE' is the perfect example of what can be achieved :D  Detailed Review - Real World Non-Technical  DESIGN AND BUILD: The moment you open the box, you realize that this is not a phone which is cheap on the outside. The build quality is beyond excellent and the crafting of the entire phone is done meticulously. The back surface is what stands out as it helps in this large phone from not slipping off your hand. I am not going to describe the technical details of the build and external features (its all there all over the internet) but after using the phone for nearly a month now, I can say that everything on the phone body is made to work and last. The phone is very pleasing to hold in the hand. The simplistic design philosophy works beautifully and I love it. For most of the time, its perfectly usable with one hand. The USB connector cable and the charger are also excellently built. In all, this is closest to an Apple device (i own many apple devices) in terms of its overall build quality.  HARDWARE: The screen is gorgeous to look at. Its bright,crisp and color accurate to great extent. I do have the dreaded \"Yellow Tint\" issue, and I did report to AMAZON about it but nothing happened post that. Having said that, even though it may seem annoying, there are ways to not make it visible (via a software fix) and for me it works. Not having a phone like Oneplus One in hand (once you get used to it) versus having it with the minor issue is not something I could do.. Every technical device can have nagging issues and its up to you to decide how much of it can be ignored over everything else that device has to offer.  The back camera is good and although there might be better cameras in other phones, I being a photographer by profession can say that it works perfectly for what a phone camera is meant to do. It also shoots images in RAW (Adobe DNG) and produces files of around 16MB each which can be edited in professional applications like Photoshop and Lightroom later to satisfaction.  The front camera is again decent and works perfectly. Low light performance in both the cameras are satisfactory to a level where it will never annoy you.  SOFTWARE: Since the release of the device there has been a lot of confusion and drama regarding the software running on this device. The version of CYANOGEN loaded on the device works beautifully for most of the time. Again, with all softwares, bugs will always be there. The gesture and lock screen issues crop up sometimes but again with few tweaks one can avoid it. The phone has never hung during almost a month of continuous use even with some serious amount of multitasking. Now since CYANOGEN wont be officially updating India Specific devices, the OTA wont happen but flashing of new version is still legal. I can only wait and see what the Oneplus One's own software will offer, but for now the current software is top notch.  A few lines on the battery performance of the device (since almost all smartphone users have this as their biggest concern).. Its battery performance STELLAR !! I haven't ever used a phone as big and beautiful as this which lasts this long. PERIOD !!"], ["5.0", "Beast !

Though it is 5.5&#34; screen, feels like you are holding a Nexus 4 in your hand ( I have used it before).! Back finish gives an excellent feel and grip. It surely makes you unique.!  2) Chipset and Display : well, frankly saying, I am not a geeky guy to mugg the features and variety's of chipsets available in market. But I can surely tell you that this phone ' Never say No' to all your apps and games. Enormous 3gb of RAM provides you a countless opportunities to explore the world. It comprises a very crisp and clear display. I have used Nexus 4,iPhone 4s, Xperia Z, Lumia 920, Desire 820 and recently had bought Redmi note too. But in front of this beast, no one even dare to stand.  3) Camera : It's interface is awesome ! Easy to capture and also easy to chose manual exposure, ISO and effects. Captures detailed pictures in daylight. But I have observed bit blurry images which were taken in evening/night.  I might write a book full of review just like the one of Chetan Bhagat's !

But the mazor problem is it is taking more than 5 hours to fully charge the battery in switch off mode which i donno why.May b due to a new battery.(4/5). * Touch responsiveness is not up to the mark. You need to press with little more power. It is not as smooth as MOTO E(4/5). * Sound Clarity of phone is ok. Not so good but it is manageable (4/5). * 3rd class ear phone provided by lenovo.

Though 1GB RAM is available, sometimes it doesn't feel enough. Yet it performs better comparing to other similar RAM equipments 2. The built-in Download application works all time so that almost all contents will be downloaded automatically (too annoying). There is an option to limit it to 512KB or wait for WiFi, but anything around will be shown as waiting to download and you will always need to clear this. 3. If you don't open the developer option and customized phone options (available for enthusiasts and experts), you can't select options like 3G only. Hence the networks alternates regularly between 3G and 2G and your browsing will be affected well. 4. Many had told about lack of earphones in the box. Yes, truly annoying 5. Any application other than Whatsapp will need special permissions to show notifications. Or else you will have to open the apps and check for latest notifications."], ["5.0", "Great phone at great price..!", "Swarn Gupta", "First impressions:  Pros: 1. Looks: Impressive considering the cost it comes at. 4.7&#34; HD IPS display does its duty nicely and has great viewing angle. Curved edges and nice bezel gives it a premium look. Although the back cover is quite slippery, a flip cover would be recommended.  2. Camera: 8mp rear cam performs well in sunlight in auto mode. Low light might not produce the original colours and will have a yellowish tinge which is acceptable since it captures the pic with superb details. 2 mp front cam is great for selfies and video calls. Fun fact: Front cam tries to guess the gender and age of the person looking at it.  3. MIUI: Mobile comes with 4.4 kitkat out of the box with MIUI 6.3.5 upgradable to 6.5.2. MIUI acting as the upper layer of Android is quite user friendly with many good features. Xiaomi has put some good working hours creating it.  4. ROM: 1 GB DDR3 ram is sufficient enough for the cost and capabilities of this phone. MIUI takes a major amount of RAM, but one should not complain about it as the phone doesn't lag with normal day to day operations. It is NOT the kind of phone to be compared with high end flagship phones. Comparing it with it peers such as MOTO E II GEN, Lenovo A6000 plus, Redmi 2 wins hands down.  5. Overall: Xiaomi has worked hard to upgrade its Redmi 1S and it shows. At this point, Flipkart is offering exchange offer for this phone, so have got it from Flipkart at 5500/-. Bang-for-buck..!! Ordered it as a regular delivery and received it in under 2 days, June manufactured phone!  Just pick it up without thinking twice if you are confused between Moto E, Lenovo A6000 plus (still selling under flash sale!) and other similar phones."], ["4.0", "XIAOMI REdmi 2", "ANISH", "Pros : &#9733; &#9733;Good design &#9733;Stylish looks &#9733;Brilliant display &#9733;Good battery life(Gives around 1.50 days) &#9733;Fast charging &#9733;Front Camera is awesome for Selfies and Skype &#9733;Call quality is very good as this has a second noise cancellation mic &#9733;Good value for money &#9733;No heating problems Cons : 1.

I said &#34;Battery Last 1.5days&#34; Why because MIUI Kills all app in background. You wont get app Notification if not opened.  NOTE: Follow the steps to solve the whats-app push notification problem on your redmi 2 device! 1. Go to the Security app which is pre installed on the device 2.Click on Permissions. 3. Click on Auto-start. 4.Select whats-app and turn it on for whats-app. 5. Now Reboot your device . Same thing do it for other apps also at a time. I am receiving all the notification whenever i switch on the data or wifi service. Same thing for Multitasking if you want to run the process in background then do it Open recent task panel, just swipe down on any app and it will be locked then wont be killed.

You can go for it :-)"], ["5.0", "Brilliant Phone (VFM)", "Varun Anil", "Love the phone, had ordered it for my friend, its certainly an improvement over its predecessor the Redmi 1S which i happen to own. *The phone has a good and sleek design with curved edges and all, is very light weight and feels premium all the way. *Uses top quality hardware components and offers an impressive battery backup along with a very useful quick charge ferature. *MIUI v6 OS from Xiaomi does good with looks, performance and is highly customizable. *The 8MP primary and 2MP secondary shooters on it are brilliant, when coupled with MIUI v6 camera app we get really brilliant pictures and they fare above expectations. *When coupled with a decent pair of earphones DIRAC (audio tech.) does magic to music and the speakers on the phone are loud and clear with impressive reproduction of depth and bass. *The phone doesn't heat up and offers good gaming experience with tons of sensors, brilliant display and sound along with a powerful hardware, although i never felt the need for more RAM during my use, extreme multitaskers will be left wishing for more. *Xiaomi too does good with their customers, listens to them and keeps them happy with updates and a lot of other services similar to Apple, another important thing is the really active MIUI Forums / Community officially supported by Xiaomi which i found to be really useful while playing around with my phone.  So on the bottom line, compared with the likes of Micromax YU Yuphoria or Lenovo A6000+ the Redmi 2 would be my choice any day as long as Micromax Yu continues its bad chain of customer service.

I found this when i got stuck because of this as it did not caught any signal when i was on international roaming on USA network. It showed no serivce all the times. I got the local sim from the local operator, then too it did not work. Finally we found that it does not support enough frequency bands to support the networks.

It just works without any lags and the tweeked android makes easier to configure the phone according to your preferences for both voice and data usage. You can configure permissions for individual Apps also. This phone has really forced me to re think about further buying apple phones as I myself now plan to buy Mi 4 (64gb) which is moreover a copy of iphone 5 s and is available at 30% cost of a I phone. You can change your phone thrice at the cost u pay for a iphone and with all the limitations of transferring data associated with Apple phones it's better to buy Mi Phones. Mi is also  offering 10 gb free Mi cloud storage with their phones for auto backup of your data in comparison to 5 gb being given by Apple.

Battery life is my first excellence point. If you use a lot of 3G it lasts one day else it easily goes on for one and a half day if WiFi/2G is your main usage. I've started d reading comics and playing games since I got this. Badland, Skyward etc work without issues on this handset. Only sometimes with hardcore multitasking there is a minor lag. The MIUI is quite nice as well. It's a tad bit slow but that doesn't really affect the performance. Speaker is really great, Microphone is decent too. Camera is good however the pictures turn out a tiny bit yellowish as the phone is completely modelled on the iPhone and the camera too.

They should offer Zenfone 6's strong battery on Zenefone 5. I meant instead of 2100, they should offer 3000+ capacity battery. I am ready to upgrade my battery. 3)  ASUS have not yet released its own Android KitKat 4.4 OS for Zenfone models. This does not sound good for basic OS version which itself is quite old now and Google might be thinking to come up with 4.5 or 4.6 soon in future. 4)  Provide separate \"configure\" app button, which may provide one of the option that allows app to be run as service (Always or whenever required) or a process. Also, it should control and close services and/or processes automatically if not being used by any any other user/process/service.

Before this I was using mini Sim. New mobile uses micro SIM, so shopkeeper cutted the sim using sim cutter and then I started using this mobile. From that moment it started displaying the Pop Up very frequently to select network between SIM 1 and SIM 2, although I installed only 1 sim. Fed up with this for 1 week and thinking it could be sim problem, I raised request to get new SIM with old number retained. I got new SIM and installed into Zenfone mobile after 10 days I bought new phone. I also tried updating Android software 4-5 times. It loaded 500 MB of data each time but failed during installation of file. Policy of ASUS for new mobile replacement is 7 days is very short. Owing to my low self confidence on old sim, I did not approach service center immediately which proved costlier. After getting new sim with old number retained of Vodafone, it added further to my miseries as call were getting dropped between conversation. The call duration could not go beyond 5 minutes. Pop ups were reduced but call were getting dropped when I used gprs connection with 3g internet. Frustated with this I contacted ASUS customer service center on 30 November by calling them and dropping them mail as well rc_india@asus.com . They adviced me to go nearest service center and get it serviced. I stay and work at Wakad, Pune and Service center is at Compuage infocom ltd, Sadashiv Peth, Pune. The distance between these two is approximately 20 kms (1 hour drive 1 way). The service center works 10-5 and not open on Saturday and Sunday. Since I am IT employee, it is extremly difficult for me to drive and drop my new mobile at above mentioned timings. I finally manage to drove all the way and dropped my mobile to service center on 2 Dec 2014. I requested him to fix the problem at one go and not make me travel to and fro again and again. I did share and provided screenshots of network drop to prove him mobile is defective. Technical Assistant informed me to collect my mobile on 8 Dec 2014 as it was fixed. He assured issue is fixed and motherboard was replaced for the mobile. Android was updated to 4.4 from 4.3. He even did not make sure that problem is fixed and verified since motherboard was replaced. I managed to collect my mobile on 10 Dec 2014. It took me 1 day to realize that problem still stays in mobile. Calls were still getting dropped. And if it stayed idle for 10-15 minutes, network goes blank. I once again called Technical Service Engineer that problem still persist with my mobile. Ruthlessly, he said to come back to service center and get it verified. There was no trust between me and service center guy of my words. I returned my mobile to service center on very next day 11 Dec 2014. He did not believe my words and used my mobile for 1 day to make sure what I was speaking was truth. The moment he put up his SIM and I called him, his calls started getting dropped and sometimes message came that 'Mobile is switched off'. I had to go to this limit to make sure that mobile definatly is defective one. I had to prove mobile defectiveness and it was not responsibility of ASUS technical service center to make sure mobile is defective. Now, Technical Service Engineer did admit that mobile his defective and requested his Regional Service Manager to replace it with new mobile. So far on 16 Dec 2014, there is no reply from ASUS service center guys i.e. Technical Assistant/Manager about replacement of defective mobile. Mobile still is with service center guys. I am very frustated owning new ASUS mobile and it turned out to be very bad experience dealing with service center guys. Nobody takes responsibility or trust words of customer.

Can be resolved with app available on offer. 4) Battery is the biggest let down of this phone. After charging it it shows 100% charged, but after 1 hr or so if you keep it idle. The battery will show 98%, I saw that and the point is Internet WIFI nothing was on. 5) RAM is may be 2gb but at any point of time available ram is 1 gb max, you need to refresh it every time you'll work with it. 6) Yes it does give lag at the start of SUBWAY SURFER game, but as the game progresses it gets better.It behaves like a EN-FIELD BULLET going ahead. 7) Internet usage is smooth..LIKE MASKA with 3G. 2G is also okay, but 3g is better. 8) Every thing said and done, but one must applaud ASUS for there R&D and updates. After buying this mobile I have received 4 upates including the  KIT-KAT update(Anroid 4.4.2). and few more firmware updates. Great JOB ASUS. They are hands on better than any other competitor.Specially better than LG and Samsung ( I have a LG mobile and also had an Samsung Mobile).

Product can best be described classifying into three segments as follows: 1.Look and Feel All Asus segment phones including this (Zenfone 5) has an cute slim look one cannot have fear of slipping out of hands.Its size happens to offer rich feel to hold weighing more than 145 grams.The three touch switches present on the front panel You will not feel pixels at all.Though the screen is of 5 inches as said, the overall length is way more than 6.3 inches.  2. Functionality: With its 2 GB RAM & Atom processor this works seamlessly without any hassles and hiccups  as many apps u open and run in the background.Camera gives excellent clarity at good light but slightly fails at little darkness but offers many features to your pictures taking each pic a minimum of 1.25MB. Speakers seem to be present only on one side of speaker Net but has good volume on ear phone and good clarity on Mic. The constant andriod updates from ASUS team appear to show considerable change in which ever functionality they put on.i had three updates so far. This is a broad description of the functionality  3.Features: This has wide number of apps pre loaded into the system like mailbox,quick memo, games of few varieties, few messaging apps, one browser and Asus specific apps(4 in number), these are good to have and good advantage to get way off using typical USB cable for file transfer. This looks very cool to use. i Didn't see any lag in the system so far after all putting all efforts to put on heavy loads.  4 Value for money: i fee this is much better than its competitors motos' in terms of its configuration, speed, heaviness,looks ,features. Yes gives good value to money which we spend on (13K - 5 % cask back on or after July 22nd). I feel this would help you to make better decision while you choose your phone on Android platform if looking for best features.Thanks."]], "title": "Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)"}

So, keep that in my mind. I obviously took feedback from my friend as well. And I hope this review helps.  The Good + HD Display. The display quality is good and viewing angles are good too. + 4G Support. A phone at this price with 4G, now that's awesome. Couldn't test the speed, due to lack of support on the network. But, 3G speeds were pretty good. + Dual SIM. I find it really odd that value for money phone always have Dual SIM support but expensive phones from Samsung and alike don't. Get an S6 or Note 4 and you only get single SIM support. What's with that? However, both SIM's don't support 4G/3G. SIM 1 supports 4/3G and SIM 2 only supports 2G. + Good speakers. Sound quality is adequately loud and clear and Dolby sound enabled. + Weight. It's not heavy and is very light to carry around. + Decent Build Quality. Okay, it's now awesome but for the price it's not bad at all. + Battery backup. Not something I could test, but while I played around it didn't seem to discharge very fast. My friend said the same. Though, his friend who had another A6000 didn't have such a great battery life. I am not sure if it's to do with any updates or software difference. But, keep that in mind if you are buying this phone  The Bad - Average Performance. Surprisingly, inspite of the specs I wasn't very impressed. - No Gorilla Glass. Now, you have to be really nit-picking at this price to complain like that. I personally don't think it's a big deal. All glass scratches and and all glass breaks and I think that's what needs to remember. - RAM issues. My friend told me that often he had to clear the RAM. I am not sure if that's got do with the apps he has. But, I think this can be fixed with an update or installing any of the system RAM tuning apps. -  Picture Quality. Though it's an 8MP camera, the picture quality isn't that great. Same goes for the front camera, decent for selfies but nothing great. - 3G calling. The phone seems to lack support for 3G calling but I guess it's not a big issue if you use other video calling apps like Skype, Viber etc. - The VIBE UI. I don't like it personally; it's clumsy and not very user friendly. But, you can install other launchers.  Do I recommend this phone? Oh, god it's a very difficult decision, really. Because it's a value-for-money but so are the so many out there now.  But, that said, if you are looking at a value for money and want to avoid the chinese clones, don't get the A6000, instead get the A6000 Plus. That's right; the A6000 PLUS is the same phone but with more RAM (2GB) and more RAM (16GB) so it works and performs better and the price difference between the two models is around Rs.500.

Rich colour and Amazing contrast thanks to the clear black display. Wide viewing angles and easy to view even in bright sunlight. The automatic brightness adjustment feature could have been better since I have use a Lumia 620 and the feature just felt better in it. There are no keys in the front and that's a really good experience.  Camera:- Frontcam: Its a 5MP wideangle cam.. Perfect for people who take selfies and groupies. Rearcam: I know it says 6.7MP but it's a &#34;Zeiss&#34; large sensor and good aperture..produces amazing pictures. In daytime.... A bit grainy images in the night but manageable.  Speakers: Main speaker is really loud and clear...but I feel the could have done better job with the front speaker used while talking, lacks a little clarity...decent enough though. They should have included a camera button.  Design: Phone looks stunning with a back cover... Nokia could have done better on the back... Front part looks really nice since there are no hard keys..very elegant.  Operating System: I am a windows maniac so obviously will be bent towards the pros... It doesn't lag or crash like android.... if you are looking for a toy and not a smartphone then maybe windows isn't for you...windows10 will be releasing soon..i have used the preview and its absolutely amazing!  Performance: Fast and reliable... Battery comes for more than a day on 3G and wifi..heats up only after 2hrs of nonstop FIFA(Game)..  Apps: All basic apps are present but updates aren't as frequent compared to android or ios... If you are a guy who plays &#34;clash of clans&#34;..stay away...Given not all apps are available.. But after watching Microsoft's &#34;Build conference&#34; 2015 I am confident that problem will be taken care of.  Lastly if you want &#34;CLASS&#34; blindly go for this phone....

Pros: Good build quality, amazing cameras, creative UI from windows, light weight, wonderful Maps, comes with required apps (just need to update once after opening the box).  Cons: All the APPs may not be available as developers are not giving proper attention to Windows platform as yet. I haven't come across any other Cons at this point yet.  I bought the phone just because I liked the build quality/form factor/Windows UI, and I was really worried how I was going to migrate my contacts etc from my old phone.

Two of my friends are already using this phone and had given me great reviews... So I decided to buy this phone without further thought... I usually prefer buying phones from actual stores but given the price difference and the fact that I trust Amazon I decided to give it a shot... The phone arrived before estimated delivery time and I am in love! Truthfully this is like the last gift Nokia gave it users before closing up - a high-end phone disguised as a budget phone... The camera is awesome - both front and back... Plus the photo editors are great... I was using pixlr in my previous phone but I don't need it now... The sound quality reminds me of the old nokia phones which used to be really nice and loud.. The battery back-up is too good to be true... N with all this come the various Lumia applications which I am still discovering and loving! I had been warned that the app store is very limited but I am not a gaming person so I have found all the apps that I use - except for google chrome... but internet explorer is good too... This phone can give competition to most high end phones out there... My advice is that buy this phone before microsoft realises the pricing mistake :P  Review update after 1 month of usage 1 month of usage and I am still in love with this phone... So it's time for a longer review 1. Design - 4.7 inches screen fits well in my hand... It could have been designed to be smaller without the extra space above and below the screen but never mind... The back feels very good and not slippery... I am currently using a case so its protected well. I have even accidentally dropped it twice or thrice and nothing has happened to it... So great! 2. Battery - I love love love the battery life.. It lasts for more than a day with my constant usage - the 3g and wifi are always on and i check my mail, Facebook, instagram, whatsapp on it... N the battery saver mode is very efficient... The phone has remained on for more than an hour on 4 - 6% battery... :D 3. Camera - Or rather cameras - Both the front and the back camera are awesome and comparable to any high end phone... The colors, clarity and depth are to die for! I keep posting pics and I myself can make out the difference. The back camera app - Lumia camera has some amazing settings - I have tried different shutter speeds, iso, focus and it does make a difference.... Plus the pre installed nokia editing apps make the pictures just stand out... 4. Health & Fitness - So before this i was using a separate step tracker and a gps tracker for my cardio and a diet tracker - But u know what, all that comes neatly wrapped up microsoft's own health & fitness app... It works very well too... So it tells you the number of steps taken; for running you can set it up for distance or time as a goal; it has a calorie counter app as well - which doesn't have as much food items as myfitnesspal app but i m sure it'll improve with time... 5. There's this preinstalled app called mix radio in which u can listen to mixes according to your favourite artists or moods - and these mixes can even be downloaded for offline listening - and the mix gets refreshed every 20 days... 6. Nokia maps and here drive - are much better than google maps! Here drive even tells you if you're speeding! :P 7. The earphones provided with the phone are decent enough... 8. App store - is limited... So for anyone who's into gaming I'm not really sure if all of them will be available here... common apps like Facebook, twitter, whatsapp, instagram, medscape are all available though... So really i could go on and on praising this phone.... N u could just keep reading about it... Or u could just buy it and discover it for yourself... :)"], ["5.0", "Nokia Again Great !!!!", "Ramchandra Cheke", "Best phone at this price range !!!! Go for it.

I did not buy this phone on Amazon but bought it directly from Google in November last year (while I was in US). Since the phone has been with me for about an year now, I am tempted to write about how wonderful this phone is.  Display and body: The display has been stunning and it remains so. I am not using any screen guard or a case for last several months and there is not even a single scratch on the screen. I am not over protecting, so I can vouch for the screen quality. The back of the phone does have some signs of wear but that is bound to happen to a white phone with no case. Still, it doesn't look like it's been used for an year. My Samsungs got really ugly within 3-4 months only.  Performance: I have used Samsung Galaxy Note 1, Note 2 and HTC One and other than HTC, all Samsungs would get slow over time. I have had to reset the phones every few months to recover some of the performance back. With Nexus 5, it has been performing exceedingly well and I haven't reset it yet. The Snapdragon 800 processor is still one of best out there. I did have to reboot the phone a couple of times when the phone kind of hung, but that looked more like a third party app issue.  Battery: This is the weakest point of the phone but is still good for a day of heavy usage. After 1 year of heavy use, I have noticed marginal decrease in the battery capacity, about 10% I would say. With a moderate usage, the phone can last for 1 and a half day easily, which is what most smartphones would last anyway. Since I always have access to some sort of charging facility, the battery has never been an issue for me, but could be for others.  People have already said a lot of this phone, so I won't add any further.

After using the phone for over two weeks now, i feel its a great device for the price that it is offering. Pros & Cons (1) Its fast. As fast as the iPhone 5S. its faster than the Note 3 that is having 3 GB ram. (2) Camera:- if you read any other review on that phone they speak that the camera is below par. yea it takes more time to open that camera. Auto focus is also difficult to control.Low light snaps are below average. Camera i will say is as good as any other camera unless its compared to the mighty Lumia 1020 and Xperia Z1. (3) Battery:- its another area of concern. it lasts average 12 hrs on regular usage, a mix of browsing, camera, games and videos. But on heavy usage it drops below 8 hrs. But it is still good enough to pull for a day. (4) Google Now- its much more deeply integrated in Kitkat. its much more in practical  on giving recommendation cards based on your likes, web history and location and other updates. (5) Size and Form factor:- its very light weight, weighting at 130gm its just 12 gm heavier than i phone 5S. its very thin and sturdy the back panel will offer you enough grip, much better than the back panels of S4. Even on the pocketablity side, it fits in to the shirt pockets very easily and pocket wont be sagging down. White version is slippery on holding- watch out.  Its a value for money offering. i think its the best nexus phone ever."], ["4.3", "Best smartphone of 2013", "Indraneal b", "I bought the Nexus 5 to replace my Note 2.  First Impression: The phone is lightweight and feels very comfortable in the hand. I feel that the 4.95 inch screen is the perfect balance between screen size and portability.  Pros: (1) The phone is buttery smooth, and can easily match the iPhone 5s in this category. Running Android 4.4.2 Kitkat out of the box, it feels intuitive and easy to navigate, and doesn't slow down even while multitasking. (2) Gamers will get great mileage out of this. Asphalt 8 runs like a dream on the highest settings. (3) The Google Now integration is fantastic, right from reminders to cricket updates and the latest news. Its like having a personal assistant that understands your needs and gives you relevant information. (4) Like all Google supported phones, you get updates first and don't have to wait for months like you would with Samsung or HTC.  Cons: (1) The battery life is still on the lower side compared to some other phones, but the battery drain bug should be fixed in 4.4.3 so it may be a non issue. Expect around 10-14 hrs on moderate use (with 3G) with around 4 hrs screen on time. (2) Camera is decent, nothing extraordinary but will fulfill your day to day requirements just fine. Day shots look great with HDR, and night shots are ok with flash on. Bit disappointed that there is no stock option for slow motion video recording like the Note 2 had. (3) Don't expect fantastic speaker sound, use headphones and you should be fine.  Verdict: If you are looking for top-end phone that isn't ridiculously priced, this will exceed your expectations."], ["1.0", "After a week small but visible scratches appeared on the ...", "Ramkumar", "After a week small but visible scratches appeared on the bottom of the screen.Since nexus 5 is made of Gorilla glass 3 It should not be happened.I have done nothing that can explain such a scratch."], ["1.0", "screen crack dont buy", "Maxzee", "I had bought this phone having faith and trust in the brand Google but i feel cheated when the screen of this device is breaking again and again.The screen is so brittle that even if anything touch the screen it cracks.

For screen blank on incoming or outgoing calls: You have to calibrate the proximity sensor anf for that dial *#*#7769#*#* and then tap calibrate and follow onscreen instruction, it will calibrate the sensor. Here is some guide for some noobs who does not understand a bit technical, after dialing the number given above it will ask you bring your finger near the sensor and then move away only twice(though you can do as much as you want!).. And it will calibrate the sensor, below will be written good on the screen, you can exit after that.  2. For the heating issue: Heating while gaming is normal because the phone has good GPU(Graphics Processing Unit), so no problem there. But if your phone is like heated all the time then, here is what I did. I got my phone rooted then removed the unnecessary bloatwares (preinstalled unnecessary apps from Google) and then install Greenify app from playstore, this app will help keep your phone cool and will also increase the battery backup and one more thing don't keep unnecessary apps in your phone uninstall what you does not use. My phone runs totally cool. Caution: If you are not a geeky mind and are not aware of little technical things like rooting and stuff then proceed with caution, though you can find several videos on YouTube for rooting your phone but don't follow anyone blindly. Follow XDA Developers website and their methods instead. I soft bricked my device when I was trying to root my phone after the lollipop update.  3. Heating issue after Lollipop Update: For this problem you will have to delete the cache partition of the phone after the Lollipop update, once your phone is rebooted after the update you have to boot it into recovery. To boot into recovery shut down your phone once it is off, press power button+  volume up+volume down button altogether, it will boot your phone into recovery. Then choose delete cache partition, it will remove the data on the internal storage !!!. Then reboot and it will take little long for reboot but after that your phone will run cool and smooth. You can also go for factory reset after this process is complete by going again into recovery and then choose factory reset it will be mush better to do so. But Just remember that factory reset will wipe all your data in the internal storage but not of the SD card.  4. Buy a SD card and just dont keep the phone's memory full. After Lollipop update you can move your apps to the SD card, it is also helpfull.  Thats all folks, Hope this proves helpful. Here is my personal complaint to the manufacturere of this phone, they should have mentioned that Yureka is developers phone and could not be handled by a normal user., so that people could think before buying this phone !!

Firstly kudos to Amazon for delivering on time    Coming to the phone- its excellent. The battery on the 638 lasts almost as long as my old Lenovo P770 which came with a mammoth 3500 Mah battery. The voice quality is the best I have ever seen. Crystal clear. The touch is responsive although I wish there was a setting like on MS windows Mouse Controls which would make the scrolling become more faster.    The 1 GB Ram ensures that the phone works flawlessly even when multitasking. It doesn't hang (hardly once and that was just the Gmail app), the rest of the phone was responding. I have already dropped the phone 3-4 times and the screen looks like it can take a lot more abuse.    For 7,000 bucks I think this is the best phone out there if you don't want a zillion apps on your phone. Even in my android, I just had a few apps- gmail, facebook, whatsapp, naukri.com and a few others- all of which are available on Windows.    The best thing I like is I don't have to download any apps to clear RAM, boost memory, boost speed, clear up cache and God knows what else. The phone does all that. Reminds me of my good old Symbian Nokia E5.

Those interested in this smarphone can check out the quick review of it based on its hardware aspects.  Camera and Internal Storage: Nokia is offering a 5 MP auto focus rear shooter with support for panorama shooting mode. Notably, when the entry level and mid-range market is obsessed with selfie focused smartphones, this one lacks a front facer that is a major downside. Also, the rear snapper is not backed by support for LED flash for better low light performance. Imaging wise, the handset way too dated for its pricing and cannot be comparable to its rivals in this segment. Internal storage is standard at 8 GB and there is support for expandable storage space up to 128 GB using a micro SD card slot onboard. Also, as the device runs on Windows Phone 8.1, it gets free 15 GB of OneDrive cloud storage support.  Processor and Battery: Lumia 638 employs a 1.2 GHz quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor aided by 1 GB RAM. We have seen this hardware combination in many other smartphones in the mid-range segment and it is known for its performance that will cater to the moderate users without any clutter or lag. Battery capacity is 1,830 mAh and though the exact backup rendered by this unit is not disclosed, we believe that it should let the phone last for decent hours under moderate usage.  Display and Features: Lumia 638 makes use of a ClearBlack LCD display measuring 4.5 inches that will eliminate reflections as it employs a sequence of polarizing layers. This display carries a FWVGA screen resolution of 854\u00d7480 pixels that translates to a pixel density of 221 pixels per inch. With an average pixel count, this screen should be capable of handling the basic tasks that are expected from a smartphone of its pricing at ease.  Software running on the Nokia offering is latest Windows Phone 8.1 OS with Lumia Denim update. Also, the smartphone arrives preloaded with Microsoft Enterprise feature pack, Microsoft Office, OneDrive, HERE Maps and Drive+. Connectivity aspects of the Lumia 638 include 4G LTE, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and dual SIM functionality. Furthermore, Airtel is providing free 5 GB of 4G data for 2 months for postpaid subscribers in Bengaluru till March 31, 2015.  What we Like? -Support for 4G LTE connectivity -Competitive pricing  What we Dislike? -No rear flash and lack of front facing camera  Price and Conclusion: The Nokia Lumia 638 priced at Rs 8,299 is definitely a pocket friendly phone with a reasonable pricing. The device takes advantage of 4G LTE connectivity that is hardly a part of the entry level and mid range offerings. However, while the Indian and Chinese brands have dominated the market with their solid devices, the Lumia 638 comes with pretty average specifications and lags behind its challengers in terms of photography. If the imaging department is definitely not your first preference, you can opt for the Nokia smartphone for its super fast connectivity support."], ["4.0", "Great Phone, but lacks few things.", "G Siva", "This is the cheapest 4G mobile in India even before the technology implemented through the country.

Few things need to be considered before buying, ie) no flash, no front camera for video call or selfie, no corning gorilla glass. These are done for cost cutting, if these are featured in this. Definitely this is gonna be a best buy and it will last long with the user till 4g becomes popular in India."], ["5.0", "Excellent Budget 4G Phone...", "Thomas  Zeno", "I absolutely love this phone. I used Lumia 510, 625, 720 so I feel this has a premium touch regarding its style. Flash would had been a plus if it was there, but images which i captures in low light also has good quality compared to other phones in the same range. Even the selfie was good. the pics was without shake or noise. no over saturation in colour. Photo Lumia apps are great. Battery is a bummer, in my place with irregular network coverage it hardly lasts 8-9 hours for net browsing on E/H/H+. Battery should have been at least 1900mAH or 200mAH since this phone is basically designed for net surfing. The apps had to be moved to SD card as it fills up internal memory pretty fast, but after that there were no problems. the Home, back and search buttons should have been hardware instead of software. When they decided to use these buttons as software they should have atleast used up the space at the bottom for extra screen space. it confuses a lit bit at first. for my small hands the screen is perfect has clarity even at sunlight except when i covered it with matte screen guard. there is no corning gorilla glass protection. but phone seems sturdy enough to take sufficient beatings. calls are very clear. speakers are very good. not the same about the headphones which comes with the set. there is no data cable in the box. charger is pretty fast. though i am not a gamer, playing some games like temple run 2, subway surfers, my experience was pleasing. dont know about high end games. overall this phone has an excellent config for a low cost mobile.

Let me brief my experience with it. It is a good deal for 7000. It can run all graphic demanding games easily, the captured image quality is better than those phones in the similar price range, No hangs and device performs really well. Now the downside, some lumia devices are having qhsusb issues. That is, device cannot read os from memory hence it cannot start  and even reset(manual) will not work. In other words the phone is dead, this happens when a update fails to install properly but in my case the battery got down to 0 and when  charged back I realized this problem. Windows has a recovery tool to help with this issue but it cannot repair all devices( it can repair only dload errors). My device was not repaired by that tool. You can search for these problems on windows forum. And sometimes you have to reset your phone after battery goes to zero. And the irony is that people at service center don't have any idea about these issues and they will send your device to company(they said to me) to resolve the issue, it takes 15-20 days. I left my device at service center yesterday and they asked me to come after 20 days.

If you are looking for a Phablet in this range, then you have come to the right place. This phone is just wow. Now I'll discuss some of the basic features of this Phone. 1. Screen Screen size is 6.0&#34; (maximum) in the phablet range. Yeah, it's quite big screen. Resolution is 854\u00d7480 with 167 ppi. You'll think that the display may be pixelating, but it is not so. Screen is pretty good and there is no sign of pixelation. Look wise, it seems great. It is slim too ( 9 mm approx ).  2. Camera Camera is really decent of this phone. It's 5MP auto focus camera (with HDR mode, Panorama Mode and Smile Shot). Color reproduction was absolute. It can record 720p videos upto 30 fps. You can't get a better camera in this range (unite 2 , fire 2 cameras are almost of the same quality, but still i'll place them above this phone in camera quality. Still the camera quality is much better than Karbonn or Lava Phones of the same range).  3. Speaker Speaker is not that great. Sound gets muffled a bit. But the headphones provided are really good.  4. Memory With 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB ROM, you can't expect more in this price range. You'll get 4.68 GB as the internal storage while 1.27 GB for apps installation. Apps can be moved to external storage.  5. Processor It has 1.3 GHz dual core processor. They should have provided a quad core processor but still for normal usage you won't find any lag.  6. Battery Battery is quite good. It has 2500 mAH battery, which gives you a good backup for almost a full day, under normal usage and 7-8 hours under heavy usage.  You get Android Kitkat 4.4.2 right out of the box. It has a notification led. It has got smart flip cover with it in the box. I was able to play heavy games like frontline commando and vice city on my phone.

Still as flawless as new! One more reasons to own this now - Just launched Apple Music is your ticket to unlimited songs for 120 Rs. And 5C is your cheapest option to brilliant Apple Ecosystem. On to the review now:  So you always wanted to get on 'iPhone' and you have been slowly but surely been attracted to the 5C but could not make up your mind? Or you just want an upgrade to your age old iPhone 4 and 4S? Let's try to create an unbiased opinion from my 1 year of regular business experience of using iPhone 5C.  Please note, I am not an Apple or Android fanboy. I use what serves me best, and do not think any one company owns my allegiance. I use an iPhone with Nexus 7 FHD (take that!) Yes, I am using Android 5.1 with iOS 8.4 and love it. Also my last phone was Galaxy Nexus.  First the Pros and Cons. You will see, I have mentioned iOS pros and cons too in the review. The fact is, you cannot separate apple software from hardware and look at it objectively. Those who compare just the hardware specs are missing the point. Same goes for Macs. What you get with the hardware is an OS that is mated seamlessly with the gadgetry. Lots of work has went into it, and is in development for more than any other modern mobile OS. So when you buy iPhone - you open a door into Apple ecosystem. It may not be best thing since sliced bread, but sometimes all you need is a change!  Please do not go on comparing RAM and CPU with android devices. Treat it as iPhone + iOS. Make iOS work for your needs.  Pros:  1. iOS 8.4 is a great change for those who have been sticking with other OSes. It is modern, feature rich, and not as limiting as you may initially have thought. 2. iOS 8.4 runs perfectly on iPhone 5C. This is the latest iOS release till now and it runs as it would brand new. iPhone 5C maybe 'unapologetically' plastic but the plastic is of great quality. It is almost like ceramic - glossy and dense. Build quality is solid. Feels good in hand. 3. It maybe 4 inch' display, but iOS uses the screen real estate very nicely. Until iPhone 6, the whole OS  was optimized for this screen size. Keyboard is great. Android may have caught up with Lollypop, but still I was pleasantly surprised when I first started typing on it, it felt natural. In fact I could type faster on it than any previous device! With bit of practice you will feel at home easily. 4. Animations and eye candy is finally not an hindrance since the OS is liquid smooth. Animations, affects and drop downs blend seamlessly. If you are coming from a slow android device, this can be a revelation. 5. Many will gravitate towards white iPhone 5C - and will ask the perennial question - will the white color dulls to off-white over time? With over an year's use I can say NO resoundingly! It is still the sparkling white which I bought. Look - build quality and materials matter. 6. Very very pocketable. 7. Great for one handed use. I had a lot of one handed usage problems with on my old 4.7' phone, but this one is a sure winner in that department. Answering emails on from the bed could not be easier. 8. Screen quality is superior than most devices in market. On full brightness, it almost seems like a sheet of paper. And yes, you can keep it on full brightness without worrying about its battery (I am looking at you half of the Android out there!) 9. Audio and Voice clarity is above par. 10. Charges very quickly! Just keep a proper car charges with you and you will never worry about running out of battery on the move. If you keep it turned on with GPS for navigation and car charger plugged in, the rate of battery drain will be less than the charging rate. 11. Default is email app is a classic! Never felt the need to get an aftermarket app. Handles multiple emails accounts smoothly. 12. New Apple apple apps like iCloud Drive work perfectly with Windows for file storage. iTunes too, works fine on Microsoft OS. 13. It maybe subjective, but I find the new iOS beautiful in aesthetics. After seeing flats of Metro UI (Microsoft) and Material Design of Android, this is a breath of fresh air. Their is certain lightness in it. That being said I am also a big fan of Material Design, and was a big fan of Metro UI! 14. Hardware silent button! Don't know how I have been living without it till now! 15. Some people find the apple logo in the back sort of status symbol. I am not one of that. Although it can be advantage for some. 16. Great Camera. Never disappoints for quick candid clicks. Lots of editing options too.  Cons:  1. Lowest rung in Apple's phone ladder. If you buy it for status, a recent price drop and new larger (and more expensive) iPhones may sour it for you. 2. Apple is known to release a new iPhone around September. With this year's release (2015), 5C will likely get phased out or be sold in third world countries only. 3. Small screen :) Okay, I do believe large screen has some advantages but I think those start from 7' and above - reading books, watching movies, comics, gloating over suppressed wallpapers and so on. But then most people only like to keep a single mobile device, thus they would rather get something of both worlds. 4. Lightening cable for charging. Now you cannot just borrow USB cable of your colleague on next cubicle to do a quick charge. Better keep a lightening cable ready. I keep one at home, one in the car and one on my desk :) 5. Would not work as a storage unit when connected to PC or Mac. Those who have got used to putting all the stuff in their phones - caution! No file manager either. 6. Notification center not as robust as Android. Android Lollipop only embarrasses it further. 7. Google ecosystem is comparatively weak on iPhone. But don't get me wrong - it is still way better than Windows Phone or Blackberry 10. If you are a heavy Google Apps user, just do a bit more research before buying. 8. If you already have an Android tablet and you are paranoid about keeping your data in sync across desktop, tablet and phone - you are doomed! Hint - Google. 9. Not well localized for India - there is a Rupee symbol though. But voice playback is distinctively American. Android does it better. 10. Built quality not as good as iPhone 5, 5S and above. 11. 8GB is awfully low. You only get 5GB odd after first boot.  That's it folks. Now in short, iPhone does not disappoints for what its worth. it is good solid phone and if you are bored with similar looking android devices, maybe it is time for a change - who knows! At the same time, takes as a whole, this is a very well put together phone with a strong focus on 'phone' part. I loved its reliability, battery life and quick charging."], ["5.0", "The reason I am happy with this phone is - there is no perceptible ...", "Prakash", "I have used a Samsung Android phone and Nokia/MicroSoft Lumia Windows phone for less than 2 years. I was looking at HTC phablet before buying this iPhone. iPhone 5c is a different kind of experience altogether. It has the top notch build quality you expect from Apple. Though it is made out of plastic, it looks tough. It already survived one fall and it looks as if I will retire that only when I am tired of it.  It has only 8GB out of which iOS 8.3 takes up about 2.9 GB leaving you with just about 5 GB in the initial stages. But once you get going with a few routine apps, the space dwindles to 3 GB. The reason I am happy with this phone is - there is no perceptible lag at all. Android and Windows phone lagged so badly at times that neither the phone nor me realized what button I pressed.  Almost everything is built in right there - Siri, Compass, GPS, to name a few. Personal assistant Siri is far better than my earlier Lumia's Cortana. Siri chimes in without running down the battery."], ["3.0", "Fairly good product, but not worth the price, miserably loses in competition to even cheaper Android phones", "Idris", "Pros * Prestigious - many people saw me using other expensive phones earlier, yet no one wondered. But when I bought this phone, I got tremendous attraction from friends to mere acquaintances, everyone asking &#34;Hey, you got iPhone? Wow. When? How much?&#34; and all. Number one in brand value (even if it is plastic). * Call quality awesome. Unbeatable in earpiece, speaker as well handsfree. * Camera is fantastic. Extremely fast in capturing good quality photos, even HDR (but only in bright light). Simple and direct user interface. No complex sub-menu kind of interface. Front camera is also awesome. Selfies and video calls are crystal clear for 1.2MP camera. * Display is excellent. Best brightness control (one of the few controls given to user by Apple). * Music quality is amazing, both in speaker as well as headset. * Performance is top notch. Let it be apps or 3D games, runs like fluid for just 1GB RAM. Rarely lags are observed (1%) still tolerable  when compared to Android phones which pack huge RAMs like 2GB * Apps like weather app (if it rains, the app will show like its raining inside your iPhone), mail app, compass, iBooks, FaceTime and their user interfaces are really superb. Additional keyboard support and third party widget support are all welcome features. * 3G Internet connectivity is very fast * Some peculiar UI elements are amazing. For example, if you shake the phone, the wall paper will seem to shake a bit (you have to carefully observe that). Animated clock icon showing current time. Calendar icon too showing current date. Dynamically updating icon images is not seen anywhere. Kudos to Apple for this. * Best-in-class security. If an app wants to access your contacts or location info, a pop-up will appear asking whether to give permission or deny it. Anytime, you can change this permission in settings for every app independently. This is something missing in Android where you HAVE TO agree with all the permissions of an app while installing.  Cons: * Only 8GB internal memory and also not expandable. Out of 8GB, only 5GB is available for usage. You have to constantly backup data to your PC or Cloud and then delete them. Extremely worst behaviour. * You cannot clear app data independently as you do in Android. For example, if Facebook app reaches 300MB in my phone, I can clear only app data, leaving the app intact in Android. But, in iPhone, you have to delete the entire app (and re-install from start if you need anymore). Extremely worst. * Minimum freedom (in the whole earth) given to users for customisation. It appears as &#34;iPhone: This is what you SHOULD do and I decide that. User: Yes sir&#34;. The term &#34;jail-breaking&#34; is 100% right term as you will feel like you are in jail when using this phone * There are no in-app settings and only centralised settings. For example, if you are using Safari and you want to change some settings for it, you have to get out of the app and go to Settings app, find Safari there (among several items) and change settings there. There is no in-app settings menu for any of the apps. Worst * For low-light photos, very worst camera quality - too noisy pictures * Namesake bluetooth - they simply would have eliminated this useless bluetooth. I am not able to connect even to my MacBook Pro, which is itself an Apple product (though my Nexus 7 beautifully connects to my Mac). No bluetooth connectivity to other platform devices like Android. Extremely worst behaviour. * You cannot set your favourite song as ringtone just as easily as you do in Android phones. Complex process using iTunes need to be followed. You may also see surprises in setting caller photos. worst. * Safari sucks as a browser. Use Chrome instead. They promised &#34;Request desktop site&#34; in iOS 8. I am using 8.1 still its not there. Also, you cannot search for required text in a web page using Safari. Have to go for Chrome or Opera Mini for this. Shame on this phone for missing such basic features. * Spelling suggestions are available only in few apps like messages, mail and notes. Its missing in browsers and all others. Worst. * Keyboard always shows uppercase. Worst. In Android phones, keys change to upper case and lower case as per user selection, allowing users to intuitively know which case they are going to type. * Location accuracy is at its worst. I took a photo in one place while my iPhone geo-tagged that photo to be shot at an incorrect location very far away. Again, Android phones rock here. * Very worst phone app and calculator app. If you mistakenly typed one middle number wrong in a sequence of numbers, you have to entirely delete it and retype from the start. Same is the case with typing a phone number in phone app. For a smart phone, it should NOT be like that. Android phones rock in this area. * headphones are not much convenient to the ear and causes pain as it is plastic. They should have made it like in-ear type feeling smoother to the ear. * Buttons are not smooth but too rigid. Causes clicking noise when you press them. Also, the charging pin is too tight to connect to and  disconnect from the phone. Worst. * Wifi hotspot sometimes unidentifiable. If not identified, check If the screen is locked, you have unlock it and set portable hotspot off and on again. Also it automatically enables bluetooth also. Why unnecessarily drain battery on that? (it's well known that iPhone bluetooth is a crap). Very Worst * No widget is available for one-touch enabling of internet in control centre (where torch, wifi, bluetooth are available except internet connectivity). Every time you have to go to settings -&#62; cellular -&#62; on/off. worst. * Although difference in style of widgets is appreciable, its not much attractive as in Android. Anyway, its bearable. * Battery is not bad but still should have been with higher capacity, at least to compete with Android phones. Bearable."], ["5.0", "I love the taste of apple.", "mou kundu", "Fell in love just after un-boxing. It is an amazing phone , only limitation I have found limited storage just 5 gb usable.

Some people find the apple logo in the back sort of status symbol. I am not one of that. Although it can be advantage for some. 16. Great Camera. Never disappoints for quick candid clicks. Lots of editing options too.  Cons:  1. Lowest rung in Apple's phone ladder. If you buy it for status, a recent price drop and new larger (and more expensive) iPhones may sour it for you. 2. Apple is known to release a new iPhone around September. With this year's release (2015), 5C will likely get phased out or be sold in third world countries only. 3. Small screen :) Okay, I do believe large screen has some advantages but I think those start from 7' and above - reading books, watching movies, comics, gloating over suppressed wallpapers and so on. But then most people only like to keep a single mobile device, thus they would rather get something of both worlds. 4. Lightening cable for charging. Now you cannot just borrow USB cable of your colleague on next cubicle to do a quick charge. Better keep a lightening cable ready. I keep one at home, one in the car and one on my desk :) 5. Would not work as a storage unit when connected to PC or Mac. Those who have got used to putting all the stuff in their phones - caution! No file manager either. 6. Notification center not as robust as Android. Android Lollypop only embarrasses it further. 7. Google ecosystem is comparatively weak on iPhone. But don't get me wrong - it is still way better than Windows Phone or Blackberry 10. If you are a heavy Google Apps user, just do a bit more research before buying. 8. If you already have an Android tablet and you are paranoid about keeping your data in sync across desktop, tablet and phone - you are doomed! Hint - Google. 9. Not well localized for India - there is a Rupee symbol though. But voice playback is distinctively American. Android does it better. 10. Built quality not as good as iPhone 5, 5S and above. 11. 8GB is awfully low. You only get 5GB odd after first boot.  That's it folks. Now in short, iPhone does not disappoints for what its worth. it is good solid phone and if you are bored with similar looking android devices, maybe it is time for a change - who knows! At the same time, takes as a whole, this is a very well put together phone with a strong focus on 'phone' part. I loved its reliability, battery life and quick charging."], ["5.0", "Amazing phone", "Kiran K. Vasu", "Amazing phone! I bought three of these phones in the last couple of weeks.

I noticed that the performance of Windows Phone 8.1 was fine on the Lumia 640 XL, if nothing spectacular. Considering the the mid-range specifications, which include a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 SoC with a quad-core 1.2GHz CPU and 1GB of RAM, this should come as no surprise.  The rear camera is 13MP, and slightly protrudes from the back of the phone. It's more pronounced than the iPhone 6's bulging snapper, and means that if you're a fan of lying your phone face up and flat on a table, the Lumia 640 XL's design could prove annoying. There is also a Front facing camera which is good for skype.  Verdict : If you fancy a phablet sized smartphone but don't want to pay the high prices of that many, such as the Nexus 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, demand, then the Microsoft Lumia 640 XL could be of interest, though the lower resolution and current lack of support for Windows Phone (though Microsoft promises this will change with the 'Universal Apps' platform) might be a few too many compromises."], ["5.0", "this phone will bring back nokia in the market", "kushagra", "I was always a android phone lover..I wanted a phne undr 15 k.this seen motog2,redmi note 4g,lennevo a7000,htc desire620g,wached experts review...read user reviews ..was nt full satisfied..

So upgrading review from 3 to 4 stars!", "Varun Sharma", "Windows Lumia 640 XL Review: Hi Folks, bought this mobile on Amazon sale and has been using it since past 2 days. This I my experience so far:  Pros: 1) Big screen, with superb contrast. Text and image just pop out of the screen and is really pleasing to eyes.  2) Smooth interface. Does not lag a bit.  3) 13 MP Camera is good with manual controls like adjustment for focus or shutter speed. Low light pics are a little grainy. Have not used camera much till now.  4) Light weight! Does not heat up on extend usage!  5) CORTANA! An alternative to Apple s SIRI is available!!  6) Superb build quality and looks sturdy and premium.  7) Office 365 and Radio MIX!  8) 3000 mAh battery goes upto 2days on decent usage.  9) All Apps are sandboxed so no threat of virus. Hence there is no antivirus app made from Windows phone! Wow!  Cons: 1) If you come from Android background, this is one thing that is going to pinch you most. No Chrome or Firefox. No Google maps (Nokia maps is there). No Youtube app (you will have to buy an alternative, which I believe is better than native youtube app on android. If you want good apps you will have to spend few bucks (like alternative to MX Player). Apart from that, all other basic apps are available (OLA, UBER, Foodpanda, SBI, IRCTC etc etc.). But seriously, say bye-bye to Google owned apps.  2) Old hardware: Qualcomm MSM8226 Snapdragon 400 is a little outdated hardware for a new phone I believe. 1.2 GHz and Quadcore works well but I would be more happy if Microsoft could have updated the hardware. Still since Windows is smoother and lighter than android, you will not feel any lag.  3) No 4G support. Again lagging behind on this front.  4) Pixel density at 259 ppi. This takes away the pleasure of watching HD movies. Though this thing is compensated by clearblack display and high contrast ratio but I really wished they would have put up a better screen.  Overall: Windows platform is a growing platform, so there are some fronts where Windows will have to catch up (like apps). Overall this is a decent phone with great build, good camera, big display, dual sim and a community of its own. If you are apps savvy and lover of super fine display, this is not a phone for you. If you are productivity oriented, and use office/lync on the go, want a phone with no hassle and great battery backup, listen to music, read a lot and do basic stuff then close your eyes and go for it. As a professional, this is the best phone for me in this price range.  Update #1: I m disappointed by number of outdated  apps. No calling feature in WhatsApp. Amazon shopping app is disappointing. Zinio the magzine app was updated in last 2014. Moreover the windows platform itself is constrained. Cannot edit url in IE once pasted. Sometime text gets stuck. No scroll bar for easy scrolling, you have to keep scrolling the list with finger which is again very slow. Also, text gets blurred on some websites. I am waiting for windows 10 update. Without win 10, this phone is just average with 3 stars.  Update #2: Whatsapp has been updated with call feature. Since June, I am seeing more and more apps getting updated. URL problem also solved. Text used to get blurry in some sites, which has again been solved. I hope this trend continues!

Great value, and the Zenfone is also catching on in Japan.  As I was ready to buy the Zenfone this HTC 526G just arrived the day before, so it is the newest HTC phone, and the newest phone in town.  I couldn't help but notice how pretty this HTC phone is and the finish is luxurious.  It looks like an upscale phone to me!  There are two colors to choose from, one is glossy all black.  I choose the white one with blue edge and the case looks like it has an expensive lacquer lol!  The Zenfone is very nice but it's case with metallic paint does not feel as expensive.  The Zenfone has a lot of satisfied customers and the photos in daylight are excellent.  The first 2 nights I charged it fully and for the next 2 days the battery seem to last barely a day.  So I was pretty pissed.  They've got to cut the cost somewhere... I thought.  However, after having the phone for 2 weeks I'm happy to report that the battery lasts forever! (well, not forever but you get the idea, perhaps 5 days with minimal use.)  Right after getting it I notice the phone powers up very fast.

About me: I am a journalist who reviews tech and hence, it is really hard to please me. I didn't want to spend over 20k on my phone and that was the only limit I had set. Let's go about the things one by one:  1. Display: Really good, high pixel density display that never puts you off as long as you keep it on auto-brightness and let it do its magic in different ambient settings. Sun legibility is top notch too.  2. Processing: Although it is a really short time to say about its long term prowess but the processor and ram look capable of pulling just about any stunt. I have so installed a total of 200 apps on my phone with BlinkFeed set up and notifications on for Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, Hike and Emails but the phone never slows down for a mili second. (Previously used Nexus 5, Moto E and Moto G)  3. Battery life: Since I am mostly out and lazy enough to not charge my devices every moment, I was keen on getting a device with a lasting battery but this is a massive powerhouse when it comes to battery. I used it all day with sync on and 3G data with half an hour calling and no games and the battery is still at 70% at the end of the evening. Very impressed.  4. Keyboard: Even though I am not a fan of inbuilt keyboards, I found the HTC sense keyboard pretty usable but switched to my trusted SwiftKey on the second day to type while I swipe my fingers when walking around. Works like a charm.  5. Camera: The camera quality is several points higher compared to the Moto G2 and the front camera is perfect for selfies, even though I hate them.  6. Body: The make of the phone is quite pleasing but the back is glossy. Fixed it with a matte finish back panel.  7. Notification LED: Missing from the phone but you are unlikely to miss it that much especially with the dot matrix cover. (google it)  8. Overall: The phone is a definite value for money device and comes with that extra appeal that's missing in bland Moto devices and a pleasing HTC UI which got updated the first thing when I booted device.  Verdict: Specs on the paper fall like marbles in comparison to the overall performance of this device. Extremely happy."], ["3.0", "OK phone if you want a branded phone in 12-14k range", "Jasjit", "OK phone. If you want a named brand in this price range, this and Moto G are your options. I chose this phone for my wife because she's a selfie  addict. There were many lesser known brand phones available that would offer better value for your money, but in named brands this is a OK phone to have. There's nothing spectacular about this phone, so if you're not too demanding and want a named brand that everyone would know, go for this. Some major niggles I found with the phone is that the screen resolution is not that great. My wife's previous phone, a Xolo had better screen resolution then this phone. The phone also don't support auto-lock/unlock feature with the flip cover, so you'll always have to press the power button to turn the screen on to see any notification. That brings to another point, the phone doesn't have any notification light to let you know if it's charging properly, or if you have received any messages. Her previous 8k Xolo phone had that. The phone appears as if it's 5.5&#34; phablet but the screen size is 5&#34; with on screen navigation keys eating into that real estate.

FEATURES-The Desire 620g runs Android 4.4 KitKat (not the latest 5.0 Lollipop, but this is forgivable on a budget phone). HTC has slapped its Sense 6 interface over the top so it won't look much different to most of HTC's recent phones -- including the flagship One M8. I like Sense 6 as it's quite stripped-down and easy to use. It's also mercifully free of all the preinstalled bloatware you'll find on Android phones from Samsung or Sony.HTC's Blinkfeed news aggregator sits off to the left of the homescreens, pulling in content from your favourite news outlets and your social network accounts. It's quite handy seeing things in one place, but you can get rid of Blinkfeed if you're not keen. Powering the phone is a 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 401 quad-core processor, with 1GB of RAM, which should be sufficient to give a reasonably smooth experience.

I used this handset for approximately six months. I had migrated from blackberry curve so it took time to get used to the touch screen keyboard. I was skeptical about the user experience, but the OS is very intuitive. Some of the pros are  1. No need of BIS Service i.e monthly saving of Rs. 950 per month. 2. Good screen resolution. 3. Can run most of the android apps. I have been using using camscanner, candy crush, google maps etc. without any problem. 4. Push mail is at par with BES service. Faster than iOS and Android.Mails comes to phone before Outlook in PC. 5. Typing is sooth like silk. Nothing beats blackberry. I have tried Android, but i still swear by Blackberry. 6. As expected, this is work horse all mails, sms, alerts etc. can be accessed at one single location &#34;HUB&#34;. From any app, just swipe and you are in hub and check mails, text alerts etc. 7. Camera is good not best. But does decent job. After OS 10.3 upgrade, new features has been added. 8. Contact Manager is amazing. It updates contacts photographs from Facebook, twitter, linkedin etc. from your connected apps. 9. Anything can be shared from share icon to lots of connected apps like BBM, Whatsapp, Viber, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Mail, bluetooth, wifi direct etc. 10. BBM has been enhanced and has some of the best features. 11. Apps maker have recognized BB and have started providing apps and features to Blackberry as well. Whatsapp calling features rolled out to just after Android. 12. Entire OS look is very polished. Years ahead of Android. 13. Battery life is amazing. One full charge lasts for 1.5 days in 2G connection. with Apps like BBM, Whatsapp, Viber, News Reader, Evernote, Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, Box, Feedly, Pushbullet running all the time. 14. Blackberry Blend is amazing. Another first from Blackberry. You can check mails, reply to mails, calendars of your phone and much more from your PC, ipad or Android Tablet without compromising data security. 15. If BES Plan is activated, you can have your work and personal profile separate. 16. Audio Player is good and can play most of the file format. It also plays flac music format as well. Supplied earphone is nice and better than of Moto G and Sony. Though I am using over the ear headphone. 17. Through wifi direct data can be shared with devices in same network. 18. Can play video or audio to your TV through miracast. No need to add any third party apps. 19. Internal Memory is of 8 GB. OS takes about 5.3 GB. 20. Media card is expandable till 32 GB (this is what I have used, I have not tried 64 GB) 21. Built in Parental Control using wich you can control applications and features and sites which child should not access. 22. Bulit in Amazon App store to download and install android apps. If you want to install android apps from Google Play Store, then use SNAP for the same. 23. Use Lucky Patchers to patch android apps asking for Google Playstore connection. 24. Can browse network files through built in file manager. 25. 5 inch screen good for reading ebooks in Kindle app, reading PDF files. 26. Native Map is better than Google Maps. 27. Device is very secured and for security paranoid like me. Picture 28. All notifications is visible in  homescreen when locked. You need not unlock the phone to peep into mails, text or alerts. 29. Amazing and secure built in password manager. 30. For reminders, built in App Remember is really amazing. You can add anything.. really anything to it. 31. Virus and malware free.  Cons  1. Sharp edges, should have been a bit rounded. 2. Sharing large files with android or iOS uses through xender, super beam etc. not possible. I tried so may times. Through wifi direct this can be done. 3."], ["5.0", "Beautiful, Bold, Strong and Refreshing are the words that come to my mind when I think about BlackBerry Z3.

Windows phone was refreshing but the limitations were annoying. Having used both, I wanted something different, inbetween Android and Windows phone. And I got it and I am loving it. BB 10.2.1 is really cool. I am not a app centric phone user. I wanted a way to manage facebook, whatsapp, emails, textmessages in a easier way and found out BB10 has BB Hub which is what i wanted all these days. I am not sure if android has such an option to handle all the messaging stuffs at one place without even having to open the respective apps but windows phone didnt have it. The BB HUB, Toast messages, Lockscreen noticfication, quicksettings, picture password, battery backup (z3 with 2500 mah), BB keyboard etc are the real strength of BB 10. Hatsoff for Blackberry for such nice thoughts. The build of the phone really needs a mention. It is solid, premium and beautiful. People who didnt know about the Z3 didnt believe the price , they expected somewhere around 25K. They were really shocked to know such a phone for so less price. I am yet to try Android Apps sideloading.  Though the OS is a WOW, it keeps you wish for more, one such example is there is no Select All option anywhere in the menus of email, pictures, music or whereever though Select Many option is there.

My ideas works differently. My experience is really long in computers usage from years & years but when we talk about phone migration into mini computers i.e. is different thing. Now I can say that I can classified every phone in depth. Actually number one is blackberry operating system in all booting operating systems. This phone designed such a way that even in low configuration model this works perfectly but fast and manufacturing company also delivered super duper services by updating phone models regularly. No one can believe this but this is true that this phone works perfectly in even dual core processor like a octa core one although I am not tested this phone in gaming mode but Internet surfing is incredible from very first day and I surely told you that anyone  forget pc after using BlackBerry. After this finally number two is apple in quality but they offered two much costly phones without water resistant if we compare marketing strategy for 4 operating system models for mobile phones. Android actually making fool by providing lollipop to everyone because that's the another matter that blackberry company is not able to resist their footsteps in the market financially but technically they are very solid. Overall anyone can say that android is a free version and does not able to provide full performance of phone even if your phone is loaded with snapdragon 825 latest processor with tons of ram.

It's like looking at the next iPhone C. The device has no skeuomorphic elements (like fake leather stitches of brushed metal finish that's actually thin plastic) and it's a single piece of PC shell that wraps around the front bezel. The back is beautifully curved with a bold sharp edge on all sides that makes the side profile of the phone surprisingly thin (and is a good design choice). The plastic is however a little creaky at times with the rest of the phone but dirt and grime wipe off easily (I got the white one for myself). The front is pure black (thanks to ClearBlack technology) and seamlessly blends with the black bezel which makes the device seem more worthy than its price (add to it Gorilla Glass 3). The display size is pretty optimized for one-hand use, as is the size of the phone itself.  Coming to the performance, the quad-core Snapdragon 400 flies through most tasks, the limiting factor in some cases being the meager 512MB memory. But they are sufficient enough for versatile uses and I could hardly notice any lags in my day-to-day use.  Battery life is moderately good, and gives a days run at single charge. The charging is however, painfully slow. The display produced good contrast and rich, vivid colors. The one area it lacks is the run-of-the-mill resolution but that's granted for a budget device. Reading books (in Kindle) was an enjoyable experience, as was watching a movie. In some intensive tasks, the device does get pretty warm, but not hot by any means. Camera quality leaves something to be desired for (coming from another Lumia), but for the budget Android demographic should be pretty terrific. I personally never used the flash that much and I don't find the omission that glaring. Nokia also cut some corners by omitting the two-stage camera shutter key and hardware buttons. While I'm in great displeasure with the former, the latter one performs as good as the physical ones I had before. Another thing worth noting: you'll find the lack of a ambient light sensor much more frustrating than a proximity sensor, because the display-off-when-put-to-ear works like magic.  As for the software, WP 8.1 is a significant improvement upon WP8, and brings some parity to it with iOS and Android (the device packs Lumia Cyan firmware out of the box too). Action center is the one feature I found myself using the most, followed by Battery Sense. Xbox Music/Video still look like unoptimized pieces of bloatware, but at least they're updating it bi-weekly. Live tiles work flawlessly, as do toast notifications. Switching between the two networks (of the two SIM cards) is a breeze, and is very organized. The option of saving apps to the memory card is welcomed, too.  In short, this is a phone you'd desire if you find yourself looking at the boring app drawer all day. This is a very modern, stylish device that has a lot of points going for it, the least of which is its attractive price. The downsides are of course the ecosystem, lack of Google services and a front-facing camera (or maybe the camera flash)."], ["4.0", "awesome phone !!!!!!!", "sarvesh sharma", "the mobile is really good !!! 1. The screen is nice but little black edges are clearly visible. 2. The apps are less but they are of better quality although improvement is desired in easy to use and langauge support. 3. Voice support is not there which is desired at such competitive market. 4. Here maps are good and they are offline the best part. 5. Camera is awesome in daylight outdoor pics but not good in dark areas. 6. Voice clarity and signal reception is good well I am using mostly it in indoor places. 7. Not a game lover but most of games are running without lag. 8.

Wasted my hard earned 2000 rupees for that memory card. 9. the design and features are good, pretty slim phone,  but missing the camera button on right edge. 10. most of the famous apps whats app, facebook etc are running without lag. 11. A flash is desired in the camera for better pics in the indoors 12. Can play most of the video and audio formats but improvement is needed in the player apps for .dat files so that we can play the movies directly. 13. Much better than laggy android phones. 14. the default storage sense, music(audio player)  app is not good so i down loaded other &#34;files&#34; for managing files. 15. Mix radio is good. 16. live tiles is great 17. with 4.5 inch screen it is easy to hold and grip. 18. the screen is protected by GG3 but highly vulnerable to finger prints smudges. 19. if not require flash and front camera go for it as it is the best phone with  that price tag and great brand nokia lumia, does not look cheap while holding."], ["1.0", "Amazon selling demo phones", "saurabh", "Received a demo phone from amazon.

The screen is brilliant especially when I compare it with the 520 and 720."], ["4.0", "Great value for money", "ananth", "I own this for past 3 months, and so far, I'm LOVING IT! Before anyone takes a &#34;fanboy&#34; impression, let me clarify that I was an advanced user on android platform for a long long time. I juiced the max from the droid, seeing it change from gingerbread all the way to kitkat (but via Cyanogen, AOSP and a couple of other ROMs that were available for that phone), so I'm being unbiased in my review.  Before you buy the device, ask three questions to yourself. 1. Are you buying a budget phone with fast and simple UI being a priority? 2. Are you ready to PAY for apps, instead of scam off the pirated ones? 3. Are you ready to get adjusted to a new UI?  If you answered yes to the three questions, look no further! Windows phone 8.1 update 1 has brought the OS to a new level! From  an OS point of view, it is light on the hardware (heck, I never had any crash or hang on my set, but I did have a bit of lag issue which was resolved after the recent update) as well as the battery (assuming you dont opt for developer preview, as they are still buggy and not release worthy YET, so occasional updates can reduce it a bit. Not the case with the normal update channel though! Works like a charm). A common cry about the platform is cry for &#34;no apps&#34;, which I believe is stupid. You will find ALMOST all of the USEFUL apps or at least a replacement app to fill up the time the actual ones get ported. In point of games, however, it is not the same. Though the scene is rapidly improving, the games collection on windows platform is still pretty bad. But you have the ones like Asphalt 8, PVZ, Cut the rope, Temple run series, and a bunch of other popular titles.  Coming down to this phone in particular, here is my review:  Build:  BRILLIANT build quality! The phone feels pretty good to hold. Everything fits on nicely. No funny sounds on normal stress. The phone feels a tad bit heavy, but not that much to worry about either! The plastic body feels well built and strong. I've dropped the phone on the road during heavy rain and it survived to tell the tale without even a scratch! Frankly I was very impressed seeing that!  Performance:  One thing to remember is, IT IS A BUDGET smartphone, not a gaming phone! As long as you remember that, you will never be disappointed! In fact, you will be pretty amazed with its performance when compared to most droids in its price range (9k when I bought it). The Snapdragon 400 provides a good overall performance, and though the 512mB RAM may feel low on paper, it is more than enough for pretty much all the tasks you throw at it! Gaming on the device however is DECENT at most! Asphalt runs without a lag after the last update now, but the detail level sucks! Its a compromise they made. So if you will be gaming more on the SMARTPHONE than actually use the &#34;smart&#34; functionality of the phone, look elsewhere. However, if SMARTPHONE is what you are looking for, this is DEFINITELY worth a look!  Software:  Other than my view about the OS mentioned earlier, some other noteworthy packages that come pre-installed on the phone are: Cortana (The virtual assistant. Trust me, she is SUPER useful! If used properly, can greatly improve the productivity! Fell in love with this one!) MS Office (With Lync and Exchange for the IT folks to be connected) Nokia Camera package (A whole bunch of &#34;lens&#34; you can use, each having something unique!) HERE maps, off-line maps storage with life time free navigation (one of my fav part of the phone! The lock time is &#60;10s!) MixRadio (free for a month, has a subscription plan after it. Really cool app to get customized playlists from REAL USERS rather than program suggestions)  Camera:  It's no secret that Nokia was leading the industry when it came to mobile camera! Luckily the same continues for this phone as well! Pretty good image quality from the 5mP cam. However, it doesn't come with flash. The lowlight photography is a bit terrible. Don't even dream about clicking photos at night! But if you are gonna click pics when the world is awake, you will be smiling a lot with the pics it clicks! Another thing missing in this department is no front cam! If you are selfie addict, fret not. You can use the &#34;Selfie&#34; app from Microsoft (was known as Glam me before the recent launch of 830) to click selfies from rear camera. It worked surprisingly well! However, if you wanted to use the phone for video calls, sorry about that. You should look at other sets available at this range.  Display:  If you want the technical details.. as mentioned above, 4.5&#34; screen, resolution of 480x854 (~218ppi, which frankly is pretty sharp! Is fair enough for most of the usage scenarios, except when a page has really small text. It sucks in that scene. The colours look pretty decent. Watching videos on it is a decent experience, but dont think about dumping 720p movie collection. More suitable for watching youtube vids or other online streaming services.  Battery life:  Well, for my usage (wifi and GPS always on, brightness 70% ~5 hours of whatsapp/FB/office mails, 2 hours of music an hour and half of gaming, 2-3 hours of speaking on the phone) it leaves me with around 40% at the end of the day! So as far as I'm concerned, I'm pretty satisfied!! One more thing to note is that I keep my location tracking and step counter on too.  Music:  The loud speakers live up to their name. They are amply loud! Haven't heard any crackling of any shrill noise in the playback that I've seen in other phones which are this loud or louder. Music playback on earphones are satisfactory. Nothing that great, nothing that bad either! If you are an audiophile (even partly), keep no expectations from this phone.  Calling and network:  Given we are talking about a phone, it is obvious that even this point be covered. Though a dual sim phone, it is a SINGLE STANDBY set. So while you are attending a call on one sim, the other one is as good as useless! That is the only one, but a major issue about the dual sim feature of the phone. If you dont expect much calls to come on both the sims at the same time (home and office sim), not really a problem. Call quality and reception is flawless. Nothing to worry about here in this department.  All in all, this is a great phone and as an ordinary user, I'm VERY satisfied with it. Those of you who are hoping to install cracked apps (it is a crime, refrain from doing so! support the developers!) or custom ROMs (none exist, it is a tightly closed environment) will be disappointed though. But those of you who want a good smartphone which is affordable and at the same time is feature packed, this should be your choice. However, visit some shops and TRY the phone yourself! Reading reviews is helpful to only filter down the number of options, not the adviced way to make selections! Go to a retailer, try it out yourself, see how well you agree with the review you read about it when you compare it to your interaction with it."], ["2.0", "Disappointed with this product.", "Ankit Chandra", "This phone has a serious heating problem and bad battery backup.

Only 0.89GB for Apps installation and in that 600 MB has been occupied by pre-installed apps. My Facebook app alone taking 100 MB and what to do with the remaining phone storage. Only few apps can be moved to other storage and that apps too take some space in the phone storage. I am getting insufficient storage space after installing some 12 apps. Just 80 MB phone storage remaining and it is unable to install new apps. 2. I was unable to sync FaceBook contacts.

Add a little more to the Budget and go for a more powerful mobile.", "Anup Satpathy", "Based on Usage of a Month---Bought it for my father. Its heavy, big and make it good for rough use but then it comes with so many rubbish apps that you can't avoid until you root. Internal space is 2.5 GB- that is like it ends before you install. I was hardly able to install less than 10 required apps for him until the space finally gave up. If you are thinking that you can transfer all apps to SD then you are wrong. I got a 16 GB installed here but only 3 apps could be moved. So no matter what, you need to root to get all the power out of it which is again not recommended while its on Warranty.

I would rather want a good UI like MIUI to make it easier to operate.

It still shows as having 5Gb free on the internal SD, and 31.5Gb free on my external SD... Still, I am unable to download anything else onto the Micromax, since it keeps saying 'insufficient memory'. (Yes, I have mad the external SD as default; yes, I have moved all possible apps to external SD; all the things Micromax recommends, I've done). This is my first and biggest detractor to the phone.  Secondly, the screen itself is not always responsive. It seems to come and go with its sensitivity to my touch. Sometimes it takes a single touch as a double entry, sometimes it gives feedback but does not actually register the character I touched. The instructions have not been clear as to what all the swipes will do, either, so a lot of what I've learned on this phone as gestures I have learned for my iPhone or Kindle first, then tried on the Micromax. Further, even if I switch on auto rotation, I don't think it has ever let me do anything in 'landscape', always portrait mode.  As for the battery, it does last longer than the iPhone's, in my experience; that is until I switch on Data connection. Then, it seems to leak power.  This was my first Android phone, and I have to say it will be my last. Not impressed."], ["4.0", "First I wanted to thanx MMX for this great phone in this range", "Priyank Sisaudiya", "Hey All,  First I wanted to thanx MMX for this great phone in this range. I have been using this phone since last 8 month and got a very good exp with it. 1.  Greatness about the phone is its processor...Believe me I don't have any memory when I had to switch off my phone due to hung. 2.  I used to play almost all kind of game in the phone without any lag or hung issue (or game not responding s***). 3.  Camera, Wow!! you will experience a very sensible quality while using camera in day time (If you are comparing its 8mp to any 8mp phone which cost INR 30000+ then probably you are a dumb) but in dark it is just average. 4. Display is the second best feature in A120 after its processor. You can enjoy 1080p with ultra high quality IPS display. 5.  Look wise it is very rich and I like this very much. It doesn't look like it worth only 9000(When I purchased). Also it is more thin (If you didn't use Galaxy S4 kind of phone). 6.  A phone by Indian company with better specification. (Don't cry it made in China even I-Phone also now made in China)  As nothing is perfect so here are negative points of phone 1.  Battery goes sucked up faster in comparison of other phones if you are playing game or surfing the net, but if phone is on ideal mode even with data pack on and with full brightness it will stand with u till about one and half days. 2.  Memory is 1GB that's ok but with time you will feel that this is very low as you could use only 500MB while its max memory is full with OS only. 3.  Got heat up when you are playing high resolution game and charging at same time for more than 2 hours. But that's ok as all phone have same problem  Overall I will prefer this instead of spending 30000 on the other phone with this kind of processor and gaming experience. Specially when you get its fantastic looks in your hand.

OTG IS SUPPORTED and camera is 8mp snapper at rear and 2mp at front,..... and 8mp snapper with led flash gives crisp images and colour reproduction is good but nor gr8 and i love the camera app. and performance is gr8 no lags are experienced on UI and ran some heavy games on medium settings they ran fine without hiccups on medium settings..and there's a bit overheating but its bearable its not chip burningly heated....and batter dropped 100% to 70% in 40 mins of asphalt 6 and some video with full brightness. and coming to the things which i hate is firstly is its UI its ultra childish and ugly as hell never seen a UI like this really the UI sucksss so i installed the nova launcher and the ui is so awesome now and its lag free so i recommend to install a custom launcher..and another thing i hate is there's a gap between display and eargrill it catches lot of dust and should be cleaned everyday with a  sharp peice of paper and ear grill will get loose if u wipe the with cloth screen too hard thats what happened to me. and theres a led a light in ear grill which is good but it looks like cheap quality one when its lit up. and the battery life suckssss its gives 2 hours of onscreen time on heavy usage with birghtness cranked to 100%. so overall this a gr8 smartphone with some compromises i recommend anyone to buy phone...you'll surely love this beast and you'll surely hate the battery backup"], ["5.0", "Great mobile experience", "Gogo A.", "I recently purchased this phone and i would like to share my user experience. Regarding specs its all said and known however this new model comes with android kikkat 4.4 and 8 gb rom which is a good improvement from earlier version of this mobile. First of all the display and touch is very good while the camera is very good outdoor the indoor pic is not upto the mark. But still at this price we wont get samsung or sony camera. The battery life is average like most of the smartphone and with only 2000 mah we dont expect much. It also comes with three additional back panel cover. Now coming to the cons the speaker sound quality is average but good while using a good earphone. The earphone given in the box is ordinary. Having said that the clearity of voice and network availability is good and it is one of the best mobile with low budget and mid range specs. So i recommend all to purchase it.

But I have included almost all details which will help You to decide about purchasing this phone(or any other phone). So please read review completely as it will answer to most of your questions.(before and after purchase) My first review was after 1 month usage. I have edited wherever necessary after 4 1/2 months usage. kit kat update for this phone is available as on 19/09/2014. Specs in Short 1.  Mediatek MT6582M &#8211;Quad core 1.3GHz with Mali GPU 2. 1GB Ram, 8GB memory+32 Mem Card support 3. 8 Mp primary cam +0.3 Mp secondary cam 4.  user REPLACABLE 3000 mAh Li-Polymer battery 5. 4.7in IPS lcd screen 6. Android OS, v4.2 (Jelly Bean) upgrade to KitKat 7. Dual Sim Dual standby, 3G+2G, Wifi+Hotspot, GPS, Bluetooth, Radio 8. Accelerometer and proximity sensors  What you get Handset, charger with microusb cable, headphone and magic cover(optional). Screen cover(not screen guard, but you can use it for a few weeks)  First Cons/Drawbacks.(newer versions might come with KitKat upgrade included, yet I had these)  1.No kitkat update (edited: Yes, KIT KAT update via firmware upgrade(511mb) on 19/09/2014), 2. low quality headset,  3. no APP to SD (edited: Yes, KIT KAT update via firmware upgrade(511mb) on 19/09/2014) , 4. No USB OTG, No Compass, 0.3 mp front camera, no gorilla glass protection  Pls read detailed review completely  1. PROCESSOR:  NO LAG FOR PHONE: 4 cores at 1.3 GHz max. Each core can work in 5 different states (598,747,1040,1196 and 1300 MHz) independently. So power management is perfect. When phone is in idle mode, only one core is working@598MHz (as seen by app Resource monitor) and at max 4 cores @1300 (seen it rarely)  2. RAM: SUFFICIENT: 1 GB ram is sufficient for all applications. In my one month usage i have seen that at least 50 mb ram is left even if we load many applications. If we boost phone with boosting software (preloaded), we get free ram of about 600MB.So OS just takes about 450mb ram  3. CAMERA: -0.3 MP front camera is a slight DRAWBACK. But if we take photo in enough lighting, its ok. -8 MP CMOS rear camera is sufficient. Default camera setting is 6MP(to see n  take image in full screen) we can change it to 8MP via settings, but the images can't be seen in full screen when we shoot. -Special camera modes are HDR (we get high clarity pics), Face Beauty, Panorama, Multi angle view (something like 3D imaging), Smile detection, Best shot...  LIVE PHOTO MODE-YOU GET THIS AFTER KIT KAT UPDATE-it takes a photo along with a few secs of video. -Touching and holding camera button will give a continuous shot of 40 photos in 6-8 secs -LED Flash is good. It gives good pictures in absolute dark (room environment). Also a preloaded App makes it a torch[AFTER KIT KAT UPDATE-app no longer needed, it can be opened from notification panel-toggle -function menu]. -Video recording: good. Videos can be seen in laptop with good clarity.  Also there is continuous Auto focus(some mentioned that video runs out of focus if phone is moved). But there is a delay for one or two secs. But still video is OK.  4. BATTERY. Using live wallpaper, Wifi, Bluetooth, GPS unnecessarily will drain battery: It is a user REPLACABLE 3000 mAh Li-Polymer battery. Lasts a day for medium use. For Heavy use: - it reached 15% when used as a navigation device ie, GPS on, display On, Mobile data (2G) ON for 8 hours. For normal Use it last 1.5 days and more (just calls and messaging and some browsing). -Charging 1-100%:- approx. 200mins via USB 2.0. It takes half of that via AC charger *Use USB charging:- battery temp is just below 30 degs, but via AC it reaches upto 35 degs (seen by using a battery monitor software) -Playing asphalt 7: playing for 30 mins with full brightness and full volume costs 10% battery (asphalt 8 working and takes almost same battery, but slight heating of mobile occurs) -Video playback: Full volume, Full brightness, full HD: for 30 mins we loss 10% battery -Face book via 2G: 30 mins costs 5% battery *After full charging if we use it for 10 mins or less, battery drops to 97%.  But after that its ok. *advantage of user REPLACABLE battery: your phone gets struck/not responding and power button does nothing!, pull out battery and restart phone.  5. DISPLAY: feels like HD: 180 degree viewing angle 4.7 inches qHD IPS. Good display, Good clarity and brightness. Use glossy screen guard instead of Matte finish type to get perfect display. We can see HD movies etc with perfect clarity. -Touch response is very good.  A small gap from display is sensed (we dont need to touch display, if you can really control your hand, Try it). 5 point multi touch is good. *I called Lenovo and they told me that display is made of glass, but NOT GORILLA GLASS. -I have a few issues with touch sensitivity when i keep phone in my pocket. When power button is pressed, it instantly locks phone and display is off. But display becomes ON (due to some notifications) and phone unlocks automatically and calls are dialled. When a notification comes, display becomes active- since our skin is near the display(has a capacitive effect even if our shirt/fabric is in between just like touching with fingers, but here a lot of frequent touches) and  these weird actions occur. I found that it occurs with all capacitive displays. So to avoid it, use a phone cover which covers display also or keep some paper/notes in between  . Edit: there are apps in playstore to sense whether phone is in pocket or not, use it(gravity sensor apps&#8230;) -The 3 capacitive buttons (like back, menu ) are backlit. So its easier to use in dark environment. Also they are not onscreen. So we get full display for viewing -A total of 18 home screens can accommodate all app shortcuts/widgets. So a 20x18 = 360 apps(normal icons)+ 4 in app dock at bottom, can be easily accommodated. Also if needed drag one app over other to create an additional folder.  6. SOUND and  MIC: good Speaker is good, not stereo (only one). Some people complained about very low volume. But i didn't feel that. Speaker is loud and clear. If volume is set to high (level 15) there is a slight distortion rarely for some frequencies. Mic: there are two microphones. one at bottom of phone (primary)and one at rear(noise cancellation). Phone gives clear calls due to the additional noise cancellation mic in rear of phone. About included headset: LOW QUALITY HEAD SET. But its OK in a quiet environment. No ear cushions. Also they are not noise cancellation type and also not \"in ear\".  7. STORAGE 8 GB internal memory.  Only approx. 5.7 GB available to user.  Upto 32 GB microSD card support. I use class 10,16GB MicroSD.(edit: now upgraded to strontium 32GB class 10-UHS 1 ). NO \"APP to SD\". So we have to be careful about number of apps we install.  Also NO \"USB OTG\". So no attaching of a pen drive. Edit: AFTER KIT-KAT UPDATE \"APP TO SD\" IS ENABLED. How To enable \"APP TO SD\":- Go to SETTINGS-STORAGE: set \"default Write Disk\" to SD card. It will tell you to restart phone. After restarting, apps can be moved by going to SETTINGS-APPS:open each app and move. We cannot move all apps+some app data to sd card(some system apps).  8. DESIGN Slim Metallic design.  Premium look with titanium color.  Brushed aluminium back panel. Good for one hand operation.  No fingerprints n smudges. There are 5 connections (like gold plated) coming to the back panel. It might be for antenna or heat transfer (don't know). Battery is just under that. So if we hold phone in hand, temperature of body is easily absorbed by back panel and reaches battery. So using protective case is good (free magic case). Don't keep phone over a hot surface or inside a hot car. It will reduce battery life(not battery runtime, simply your battery will be useless fast and you have to buy a new one).  9. FREE MAGIC COVER/SNAP STAND Acts as a stand(vertical/horizontal) and also protects phone as a bumper case. Thanks to Lenovo for that. All my friends liked it.  10. SENSORS Proximity sensor: good response for the sensor. But when we move phone from ear, the display is not suddenly active. It has a weird delay(this issue is less after firmware upgrades). Accelerometer sensitivity is good. Proximity sensor becomes OFF if we attach headphone. Notification light: red for charging, Blinking blue for missed calls, blinking red for mail, blinking green for SMS. GoTo SETTINGS-DISPLAY-LED Notification Light sensor: At front near proximity sensor. Good. It controls display brightness if AUTO brightness is set. So display changes brightness, but occurs also during playback/ gaming(sometimes not so attractive/flexible). NO COMPASS. But while navigating display automatically adjusts to route  11. PRELOADED APPS: Lenovo SECUREit: An all-in-one app for anti-virus, privacy, speed up, data usage control , anti-theft, private space (for calls n sms) , call blocker and parental controls. What I really liked is the firewall in data usage section. We can set which apps are permitted to access internet. So I can save a lot of data Also speed up via clean up widget (update secureit to latest version) is perfect. More ram is freed compared to any other Clean up utility.  Edit: Lenovo SECUREit is now SECURITY. And it&#8217;s a trial version. I had a subscription. But I lost it when I did a reset of my phone. So I contacted Lenovo team and they replied that it&#8217;s a trial version, and we can&#8217;t uninstall(requires ROOTING which voids warranty), but disable it in app options. when trial version ends we can use it but we can&#8217;t update antivirus. all other functions works perfectly.  Mobile assistant (in phone and PC): Just like a PC suite. All functions (uninstall, back up...). Also we can view what is on mobile display, but with a 3 second delay (usb2.0). Note: when we connect s660 to a PC, \"USB computer connection\" pops up. there is an option for CD-ROM which gives some cool apps for PC. Copy it and keep it safe. After K-K update this  no-longer avaliable EDIT: After Kitkat update, installing mobile assistant in PC+ enabling USB debugging will install mobile assistant app in phone. So backup your cd rom contents.  Video player: It is ok, but does not play all files like mkv.. So i used Kmplayer for HD playback.(or MX player) Edit: video player app icon not avaliable after K-K update, but when we try to open a video, there is option to select video player  Navigation: Route66 maps: very good. Download map pack for India (1.23 GB) and set install location to SD card, which saves phone memory. AGPS: can set profile GOOGLE or NOKIA. Also EPO (extended prediction orbit of Mediatek. An offline server based  AGPS, download it) is useful. (you lose this after K-K update)  Tethering: WiFi + hot spot. All modes of tethering supported(bluetooth, USB). Has option USB internet: we can use internet from  our PC to our mobile (Reverse tethering)  The softwares used for monitoring are Resource monitor: it shows a floating bar which shows current Ram, core speeds n numbers etc. And Battery+ for battery. MY EXPERIENCES I selected this phone with help of some websites. \"Smartprix\" for selecting best phone in this range. \"Buyhatke\" to select best price from different sellers. Thanks to Amazon for hosting this market place, and delivery to my place (no other E commerce website delivers here).  Also phone was delivered by FedEx in 4 days (Mumbai to Calicut in two days, +2day, a slight delay by FedEx as my place is a little remote)  Seller(TechKitchenDeals) was nice. They replied to all my queries promptly before and after purchase.  ALSO WARRANTY IS VALID. I contacted seller after purchase and they guaranteed about warranty. Also I checked Lenovo site. My phone warranty is valid for 1 year from date of purchase (14 June 2014). You must get a VAT bill with Seller Tin number and one (primary) IMIE of phone  At the time of my purchase this phone was best budget phone (INR 11150)from a good company. Indian manufacturers also provide phones at this or higher specs. But I feel LENOVO is better than them. Lenovo has a reputed Brand Name, history in computer manufacturing.  Now Asus Zenphone has come. But S660 still has a user replaceable battery, Quad Core, metallic body, more battery and also FM radio. So still a value for money.  Edit: Slight Heating occurs while playing graphic intensive games. But when games is closed, temperature goes back to normal.  On 19 sep 2014, KitKat 4.4.2 update was released. Check for software updates in phone (Settings -About phone-system updates). Now the entire look and feel of interface is changed. Thanks to Lenovo Team. the settings menu, icons.. are now better. Also now a lot of options are available in developer options menu. + performance increased.  edit: 19 oct:  after kit kat update, 1. WARNING: we can't install additional files to memory card. So asphalt 7 (or 8)additional files must be downloaded and installed in phone memory(consuming> 740 mb). and route66 maps for india also(1.23gb). But setting Default write disk to SD card will change this, and all data is stored in SD card and also gives you APP to SD.  2. By using developer option, we can use dalvik/ART runtimes, change animation , increase graphic performance...  Enable developer option by :- SETTINGS-ABOUT PHONE-VERSION INFOS- And tap  BUILD NUMBER 7 times (or more). Then come back to settings.  Developer options is just above &#8220;About Phone&#8221; Changing to ART(instead of dalvik,Default) will increase performance(some say so), phone will restart saying andriod is upgrading. But Some apps might fail to run in the new runtime.  3. In settings-storage. There is an option to set default write disk to phone memory or sd card. In previous versions, this can be easily changed to one another. but after KK update, if we change phone memory(default) to SD card, phone must be restarted. AND also \"\"APP to SD\"\" becomes active. but when we change deffault write disk to phone storage again, all programs must be changed to Phone memory, else it won&#8217;t work. 4. GPS option is removed, instead location option came with 3 modes- Device only (GPS), battery saving (WLAN, MOBILE NETWORKS) and High Accuracy (GPS+WLAN+mobile network)  5. In user interface, long pressing any app icon(or empty screen) will give you options to :-   1. Uninstall(click 'x' mark over icon),   2.add/remove widgets,   3. batch move app icons(clicking app icon once will send it to taskbar, click from taskbar will send it to window) __________________________________________________________________________  If you want to take a screenshot, just press \"VOLUME LOW+POWER BUTTON\" together, screenshot is saved.  Touch and go vertical down anywhere on screen-notification panel drops down, go vertical up-desktop settings... pops up  use 2 fingers and pull down notification bar-you get function toggle bar  use two fingers and touch vertically down on screen- apps will get organised at bottom and vice versa  The back panel is metal. if a sand particle gets struck between magic case and back plate , you get a shiny scratch. So when you apply a new screen guard, take the screen guard (plastic cover) that is already on  phone display and stick it to back plate/panel. but make sure to open camera, flash, speaker and rear mic regions.  one of customer (rahul) contacted me. he returned the product due to loss of wifi signal (after getting heated-video call 1 hr.) I didn't have any such issue. After chatting with him, I found that my S660 doesn&#8217;t have option for dual 3G, but his S660 had. I don't know. LATEST FIRMWARE: S660_ROW_S062_141126 You cannot get this firmware in first upgrade. So do firmware upgrades+KitKat upgrade till you get this. 141126 is date -2014/nov/26  Sorry if this review was a long one. There might be some features I have omitted/forgotten/not yet found.

Pros. and Cons. listed below based on my 7days observation.  Pros. : 1. Primary Camera(8MP) provides really good picture quality. 2. Performance is really smooth without any lack.

No centralized menu option present need to store all the Apps shortcut . You have to store all of them in desktop with folder structure. 2.

Good service from Amazon guys.  Started using and was extremely happy with most of its features. The battery lasted for 2 days (Day 1- 8 am to Day 2- 10 pm) with full usage (since i was syncing all data and accounts) and testing all features. Also, there was a phone update available (~100mb) so i installed the update. However, once I synced all accounts and data, it started a weird behavior. It re-started abruptly while operating. This happened a couple of times first. The next day, it was worse. It could happen any time, while taking calls, dialing numbers, checking mail, operating any app, or even just unlocking the phone. Immediately reported to both Amazon customer care and lenovo customer care. It seemed that there might a software issue since I installed an update (which might not have installed properly). So, the next day, I went to lenovo service center (Indiranagar, bangalore). The guy updated the software. Tried it for the weekend, but to no use. The same problem cropped up again. Finally, I returned the phone to Amazon, with full refund.  Key takeaways.  1. Don't update the software- Although that was not the problem with me. But, the lenovo guys are themselves not confident about it. There were at least 2 more customers (when I went) who had a software issue. 2. Be prompt when you see a problem, you can get your money back.

The camera is not that bad as pointed out by some members unless you have huge expectations. The audio quality is decent and  call quality is also good. Stock android games like temple run without any stutter. Kitkat was supposed to get officially updated but it is surprising that no update is still available.

What is good: - The performance is good, I did not notice any lagging even while playing &#34;Asphalt 7&#34; race game. - In phone stand by mode (screen off) battery can last at-least two weeks. I enabled only 2G n/w. - SIM card slots are of regular size.  Average: - Less customization of screen, settings, individual volume controls, not possible to change LED notifications colors. - Interface is average+, setting options are not too high just average which are fine for may users. - Signal reception is not great (may be it is because of low SAR value) - Not so thin but no thick also. - I heard no stable kitkat update, they are about to release one more patch for Kitkat. So I did not plan to upgrade it now.  Bad: - When screen is awake(ON) then battery drains fast (no WIFI/DATA connection enabled), if &#34;auto brightness&#34; option is not enabled I belive within 10hrs battery will be empty for sure. - Front camera is VGA/0.3MP (I compromised here while buying) - Tough to open the back panel, and to insert/remove the SD card or SIM cards battery needs to be removed though those slots are beside the battery. - There is no magnetic sensor(same is present in my 3.5 yrs old-galaxy pro phone) that means we can not use compass applications to know the poles and even GPS navigation also may not be more accurate. - Came to know that customer service is bad.  As I got this mobile for 8k approx I am ok to use it further. However if you have to spend more than 10k better to cross check.  Note: There is no need of buying this phone because of more battery capacity."], ["5.0", "best smartphone", "Smit Patel", "for all those who dont know about lenovo its simple.

Alternatively use a pen or screwdriver first. 2) Uses a mini sim (something not mentioned in the description) 3) User interface does not support removal of app icons from desktop. You'll need to create a separate window on your desktop which you will rarely use and push all unwanted icons there. Makes the desktop cluttered. 4) Speaker quality could be better. Music plays with a small amount of distortion but disappears when listening via earphones 5) There are no proper user manuals for operating it.

Nevertheless, I think there are some basic pros and cons that I have figured about this phone over the last 2 months, and here they are:  Positives: 1. The battery is good... 3000mAh is great to have. A single full charge can last two days (but of course, that depends on how you use it and for what) 2. SAR levels are very low compared to some other brands, if you are concerned about roasting your brain (which I am). 3. Looks absolutely stylish!  Negatives: 1. The loudspeaker is rubbish! Even at about 60%, you have to be selective about the ringtones you use. Something with a little bass in it, and the speaker starts sputtering and crackling... very irritating and not becoming of a phone of this quality! 2. The automatic brightness control is haywire and is basically of little use. You will have to either leave it at a high level and let it be, or keep changing it manually depending on the ambient light level... which can be a bit dicey if you suddenly go into sunlight and have to make your screen brighter... and you realize you can't see what's on your screen to make the change. 3. I thought the dialer was very drab and boring, but that can be remedied with Truecaller, Truedialer or any other similar app, so it isn't that big an issue.  Overall, I love this phone, and I think for the price(8.3K) and the quality offered (not to mention the Lenovo brand name), it is a great buy."], ["5.0", "Killer Battery, Optimized RAM and Fluent Touch. Best at this price", "sudip", "Bought this product after a lot of research and zeroed down to this. Criteria for selection 1. Good Screen Resolution ( I already own a couple of Nexus phones, so kind of used to it) 2. At least 1 GB of RAM ( needed to make it process stuff smoothly) 3. Battery (bigger the better)  The lenovo S660 comes right of the block with great build and specs fulfilling all my above criterion. Here is the experience of Unboxing and Usage after 2 weeks. The phone is well packaged and comes with a free case which has a brilliant flexi back which when flipped makes the phone rest in portrait and landscape mode for easy use. All accessories like charger, headphones come with it The display although mentioned as IPS doesnt feel so, but has a robust build quality and the titanium metal cover at the back feels good in your hands. The rear camera is decent and do not expect any miracles. The megapixel race doesnt translate into clear pictures. Processing is super fast and absolutely no lag in the user experience. The UI is good but however resorted to the Google Launcher. App drawer is missing. A security app always runs in the background and am surprised with its optimized usage of RAM. Brilliantly done Lenovo on that. Wifi connectivity is good, however the mobile signals are a tad to weak, but doesnt result in any call drops or quality. And the biggest surprise of all is the monster of a battery. With 3G data on and almost 6hrs of talk time in two days and surfing for an hour and playing videos for an hour, the batter still shows me 20% left. I simply love this phone for this. Looks all the other sins have been redeemed.

Now the things that is annoying: - Why do they have to be half witted in making the user interface? Fine they have tweaked here and there; which makes it look good but at the same time they have left some portion pretty much stock, half hearted effort, which by the time you will update to Kitkat will find they have made no effort, perhaps they less bothered of mid end devices. - This phone is \"haunted\", believe me it wakes up with no reason, you keep it in your pocket and next you find it woke up and somehow managed to open whole bunch to apps. Although with Kitkat update it has been contained. - Toggling between 2G to 3G is pain, each time have to dig in deep for settings. - Camera, don't leave the settings to auto, it makes photo soft and fuzzy.

Few bugs in the OS.", "Anup", "First of all amazon delivery service, like always, is just amazing. Ordered it on the day of sale and got it delivered on Friday.  Now coming to the phone, the design looks nice but has a glossy back. It is prone to slipping and fingerprints. There is only 1 button on the front size instead of the standard 3 buttons system of android. This definitely takes up a good amount of time to get used to. But there is a youtube video explaning the meizu OS features and tips and tricks of using the phone brilliantly with that button. Check that out as it really helps. Now due to merging all 3 buttons into one, there are few glitches which you can see around in the OS. Like once, I took a picture and after I viewed the image, the back button never appreared on the screen. I had to completely kill the camera app and reopen it as I was not able to click another picture. But next time when I clicked it, the back button appeared normally. So like I said, it's glitchy.  Coming to the camera, the back is good, not great. I clicked the same image using Oneplus One, Asus Zenphone and Nexus. The colors of the image clicked from meizu came out a little dull. You however get a lot of inbuilt filters which you can use to enhance or completely change the look and feel of the image. Dont know if I had to use some different settings while using the camera but I clicked it in auto mode and with default factory settings. Front camera is amazing though, perfect for selfies if you are into those kind of pictures.  The screen is great. Amazong clarity and with nice details colors. It is 5.5 inch but it doesnt feel so big in hand because they have used around 72% of the front side only for the screen.  The phone comes only in 16GB with NO EXPANDABLE MEMORY. You get around 11.5 GB of space free. I keep a lot of songs and games on my phone so this much space is insufficient for me.

I am writing this review after my 2 weeks of usage. I like the phone, its design & performance is awesome and it is also a pretty budget phone. A good choice for the users who shift from android to windows. It has all the main features like 1GB Ram, 5MP Camera (Superb picture quality even without flash at daylight, not preferable during night time clicks), 1.2GHz Snapdragon 200 quad-core processor (Really superb quick), its capacitive touchscreen gives you feather touch experience. When comes to Battery backup it gives you full day fun with one charge even connected to WiFi all day long by texting, gaming, browsing, and one more special feature is it's Battery saving feature gives you complete 8-10 hrs standby to attend phone calls and texts when battery down to 15%. When come to apps it has all the popular apps that we regularly use and don't compare the windows apps with android apps(you will surely disappointed with missing features), but this phone has nice user interface and it never get hanged like android phones. This phone had windows 10 update guaranteed by Microsoft and we hold latest OS in our phone in future also. Additional Benefits: 1. Paytm gives you 750/- cash back(150/- for 5 months) on recharges done with its app 2. A great discount on Bus booking using Redbus app 3. Airtel gives you 500MB 3G data for 2 months. 4.

Why find out in the review below!", "Sayan Sarkar", "Nokia 532 comes equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdargon 200 1.2ghz quad core MSM8212 proccessor with an Adreno 302 gpu. This is just okay for the price of 6k-7k. Yes it's definitely a good initiative from Microsoft to provide an alternative lumia for the budget seekers but I think this phone is dated. Plus why should someone go for Lumia 532 when you can get Lumia 630 with a Snapdragon 400 cpu and a clear black 4.5 inch IPS screen for 6k.Yeah it's true that Lumia 532 comes with 1gb ram but it simply doesn't have the cpu nor the gpu to fully capitalize on. Since this is a windows phone the 512 mb of RAM would be more than enough for all day to day usage and only while gaming on high graphics the defieciency of RAM maybe felt.Even you can go Lumia 638 with all the internals of Lumia 630 plus the 1GB of RAM is available at 7k, i.e the same price of 532! Since not only the performance, even the screen quality of 638 is much better than this. People looking for a good phone at this price (irrespective of the OS i.e Windows or Android) go for Android one for 5.5k or you can even wait for the Redmi 2 that's expected to come in a few months for 6k. Microsoft introduces this phone at a time when budget users are spoilt for choices with so many alternatives at their disposal. Had they done it a year before then it might have attracted buyers but not now. plus their pricing policy is also strange! They are even competing with themselves by making Lumia 630/638 sell for a similar price! Only pro of this phone is that it is a dual sim variant while the 638 is not. But you can get a dual sim variant of 630. And only for this feature I am providing 3 star. Otherwise it would have been two!

{"url": "http://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-S4-GT-I9500-White/dp/B00CL4HXQC", "reviews": [["3.8", "ONLY REVIEW YOU HAVE TO READ!!!", "Ankit", "I'm a developer and I have been using s4 since 1 and half years I'll clear all your doubts regarding this phone ihv used black mist and white and last week ihv bought one deep black for my brother using this phone for a week till my brother comes from out of town.. 1-people say that mrp is less 23500 and Amazon cheating\u001b\u001b\u001b Mrp is lowered here coz they want to save import duty just imagine already samsung is selling the phone at cut throat price and they want some profit also.. So less mrp low import duty and profit business model.. 2-PHONE HAS NO WARRANTY seriously this was the most stupid question I heard in the reviews when clearly written 1 year manufacturer warranty and above all amazon and flipkart don't sell products without genuine manufacturer warranty.. That's why I prefer only amazon or flipkart.(courier service and customer support of flipkart is better) 3-PHONE IS MADE IN VIETNAM samsung's largest factory is in VIETNAM and again 3 billion dollars samsung has invested in November 2014 in VIETNAM for new factory also VIETNAM govt has given samsung no corporate tax for 4 years and for next 9 years half of corporate tax.. So obviously they'll make there phones.. According to samsung making phones in VIETNAM is 4 times cheaper than making in China and 6 times making in india..so less labor less tax.. That's why made in VIETNAM and phone is cheaper for us 4-WHY FLIPKART AND OTHER SITES SELLING IT COSTLY? WHY I SHOULD BUY FROM AMAZON CHEAPER MEANS CHEAPER QUALITY OR DUPLICATE? FLIPKART AND OTHER sites have the old stock which was made in India and with mrp of 33500/ obviously they can't lower than 22k to earn profit.. Also there's a contract between samsung and Amazon and flipkart for products like galaxy s 3 neo for 12.5 k only on flipkart and 17999 s4 only on amazon you check price of s3 neo on amazon it's 24k so that doesn't means it's fake and all.. It's market strategy to live and let live others.. Every one gets there share 5- why samsung has lowered the price it's worst brand? First of all the product is too old it's 2 years old and in technology world 2 year means millions of years.. Those who have bought phone for 42k already have switched to s5 or some other high ends.. The price lower is a good sign for middle class public in india so that they also can taste what a flagship is.. Let us not whine let other people also should enjoy the privilege of buying high end phones from reputable brand rather than buying from some cheap companies don't be like whiners initially we shout samsung phones very costly what the hell when samsung lowers the price we again shout samsung bad company they lowered the price.. Samsung doesn't give lollipop rom fast when samsung gives than we shout why you have given kitkat was better .. Be grateful guys 6- SAMSUNG MAKES PLASTIC PHONES? What material will decide the technology.. Seriously.. OK plastic have better network reception more durability lighter in weight.. Remember our beloved Nokia 3300 & 1100 all plastic throw them and they are again intact because of plastic only and mechanism of disamble.. As soon as it falls phone back cover battery opens thus distributing shock so the screen doesn't break.. So I'll say it's blessing in disguise.. I have 2 nexus and one iphone trust me a memory card is really a big deal your data is so secured whatever happens format.. Service Centre whatever s your SD card is there with all your data and as soon as you get phone you're ready and yes the white frost and black mist are too shiny and slippery.. So personally I'm also in love with deep black with leather back. 7- THERE'S NO LOLLIPOP UPDATE FOR DEEP BLACK? YES at present there's no lollipop update for deep black edition only black mist and white frost model.. But it will come surely after a while.. I have updated my other phones with Lollipop trust me there's lot of bug that will irritate you to the core so kindly wait for the proper build and bugs to be fixed even google lollipop has bugs today or tomorrow android 5.1 with bug fix coming to nexus and android one in india.. So kindly wait samsung will take time to clear all bugs may be months.. I would advice don't flash with Lollipop now by going to service Centre they are flashing white frost and black mist firmware.. There's only differnce of wallpaper and ringtone between other s4 and deep black.. 8- xiaomi Mi4, lg g2, over plus one or Samsung s4? Very tricky question i have used mi3 trust me it's pathetic cheap shiny material built looks like some kids have made the phone the fitting is not proper sim card doesn't eject properly so I don't expect much from xiaomi there are just better lava phones with good publicity department there rom miui is almost copy of ios and above all it has lot of bugs and service Centre support is like nothing.. You can buy xiaomi phone but I would say only redmi kind phones for, 5k 6k as a secondary smartphone. Lg g2.. Probably one of the best choice but price of g2 is still not stable it is better in every sense from camera to processor from battery to ui.. If you get for 20-21k go for it without any doubts One plus one.. Yeah it's again a chinese phone but this one is seriously different from xiaomi and all awesome built brilliant screen better camera..64 gb store Good buy if you are in Metro where you have customer service support also it's 5.5 inch Phone.. I like bit compact phone.. Personal choice if you like big screen and you in Metro go for it.. It has cyanogen mod support that's really a big deal.. Actually cyanogen is better than Google Android though it is based on Google Android.. Sundar pichai went to buy cyanogen but cyanogen still remains Un owned.. Samsung galaxy s 4 - it has all features like full HD awesome camera and ok battery with plethora of service support so good buy for 18k..lollipop will be last official update for galaxy-s4 9-Galaxy s4 heats lot? Exactly it heats a lot coz the processor was half cooked samsung made a octa core which is actually 2 quad core it's not octa core phone the two cores never work together if more fuel required task than 1.9ghz core works when less task than 1.2ghz core and in battery saving mode.. But there's no synchronization so many times it heats up a lot which is quite normal with all smart phone but s4 it's more than other phones.. Not a big deal just close your Un wanted apps. This phone has fast charging yes exactly the quick charge was experimented fast on this processor only with 2 amp charger.. It's like turbo charger It has so many sensor never have been on any phone till date even it has humidity an temperature gauge.. These all features combined with thin body and 2 quad core processor makes this phone heats lot. 10-COURIER SERVICE AND PACKAGING WAS NOT GOOD? yes the courier and packaging is not as good as flipkart but amazon allows you to open the outer box to verify your inner phone box is good.. My package was damaged and Amazon called me and asked me not to recieve this model and ordered for me one more with one day delivery and the 100 Rs extra which I had to pay was credited to my wallet\u001b\u001b\u001b I would say always buy from flipkart and Amazon.. They are most trusty and customer oriented e sellers in india  11-Will all normal s4 accessories fit in deep black? Yes almost all but few tight covers you have to apply more force than normal s4. 12- SHOULD I BUY S4? I HAVE written everything related to this phone.. Decision should be yours tomorrow you'll come should I marry this girl or not.. Take your decision that will only give you complete satisfaction.. And above all its just a phone if by chance you made wrong decision not a big deal sell it buy other Samsung is facing a very big competition and it's in a situation where it will be slaughtered by competition if it doesn't take immediate steps.. Already it has been dethroned from all countries where it was number 1 and also in 5 years it's profit is gone down and yesterday's report say it's not number one smartphone seller in world it has been dethroned by Apple iPhone 6 success which is first time in like 7 years.. So samsung is changing all its policy like s 3 neo 12k for fighting micromax nitro and moto g and s4 for 18 k for fighting mi4 and one plus one. Does samsung galaxy s4 lags? Yeah it lags sometime specially in gallery other lag you can remove by one simple trick dibble click home button in that s voice will open just disable s voice through home button"], ["2.0", "issue with the phone", "Jonnah Kurian", "It has small scratch on the side of the phone after removing the protection cover got to know it, please let me know for it concerns."], ["5.0", "Samsung service centre confirmed the warranty", "Arun Sunny", "I've contacted the Samsung service centre and they confirmed the warranty and product support is available as far as the product is genuine.

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PROCESSOR & BATTERY LIFE: S4 has 8 core processor as a combination of 1.6GHz(primary) & 1.2GHz(secondary) quad core processors.

Fantastic Camera. It supports both GPS(By USA) & GLONASS (By Russia). Simultaneous video recording with both front & rear cameras.

New Features of S4: Smart Pause/Smart Scroll: S4 senses when you look at the screen or away from it, automatically scrolls up and down websites and pauses & resumes videos.  Air View/Air Gesture: You can simply move your hand to accept or reject calls, change music tracks, browse the web and your photos without touching the phone.  Group Play: You can play multi-player games with other S4 users.  Sound & Shot feature: You can capture up to 9 seconds of audio while capturing a picture to make it interesting.  Turn Over To Mute: If someone is calling you and you don&#8217;t wish that the phone should ring then just turn over your device, ringer bell of your phone will be automatically muted.  SAR Value (Specific Absorption Rate max should be 1.6W/Kg. by FCC): 0.54 W/Kg.

Cons: 1) Phone hangs a lot. Every android phone after 1-2 years gets slow and hangs very much. Try all tricks to optimize it buts no improvement. 2) Frequent apps restart : This issue is due to Android 5.0 update, like you are using some app and suddenly it will restart, this is happening very frequently and it's very frustrating. No immediate solution from Samsung. 3)Heat very much : On playing game or using continuous for 1 hr its heats up very much. 4) Less available memory - from inbuilt 16 GB memory OS itself takes 7-8 GB. you left with only 8 GB of device storage. 5) Not for game lovers :- Big games like NFS,Asphalt,Counter Strike etc takes at least 1.5 GB device storage so after installing various apps,Whats app (it store data in device storage) you hardly left with 2-3 GB in which you can install only 1-2 games. Beware these games can't be moved to SD card they will remain in device storage only. So after 1-2 years it become daily task to delete data to make space in device storage. 6) Camera :- Its 13 MP but not comparable to even Iphone 5S. very poor image in night. 7) No future android update : it was launched in 2013 so most probably won't get any future OS update. after 2 years Samsung does not provide OS update. So meaning to buying this now. 8) No Samsung support : No option in phone/Samsung website to report an issue.  Pros :- 1) Brand Name 2) HD Display 3) Build Quality  It's 2 year old phone and now days many latest spec phone available in market in 15-20 K range like One Plus One,mi4. so its not a good buy. I would not recommend this to buy or would not recommend to buy any android phone. same story after 2 years either buy for 1.5-2 years and then change or Go for iPhone its really awesome."], ["5.0", "The best mobile one can have for INR 16499", "Balaji duraiswamy", "The best mobile one can have for INR 16499...

Usage results:  Battery : Excellent Backup in normal usage. 2 complete days (48 hrs) backup after full battery charge. And you won't believe that I got 30% battery left &#9786; thanks to 2950Mah Battery. By normal usage I meant:  playing games, social apps, calls, music.  Games : This lovely thing plays almost anything with absolutely no LAG. I play High end games like Brothers in Arms 3, FIFA 14, Asphalt 8 etc and of course basic ones like Temple Run 2, Subway Surfer etc.  Touch is super smooth with less delay. Being a SONY fan I was in an impression that they make best 'touch' in smart phones, I was wrong.. Now I am an E7 Samsung Fan.. Lovely!  Camera : Out of the world! Special treat for Selfie lovers : It got voice command and palm gesture option to take selfies. That means you don't need to struggle to reach the screen for taking selfie. Just show your palm and the phone will sense it and take selfie. And yes, they got wide angle selfie to cover your entire family or friends onto a single frame. Awesome feature!

I meant you cannot use dual SIM and Memory card at the same time. You can either use single SIM and memory card or Dual Sim with no memory card. 2. Non removable battery.

This has better specs comparing to the older Grand,and definitely performs better.  ** Highlights and Comparison **  =&#62; Quad-core 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 processor and Adreno 305 ( same combination seen in budget devices like Moto G and Xolo Q1100 ) =&#62; 1.5 GB of Ram which is good,but devices from Xolo and Micromax priced under 20K ships with 2GB of Ram. =&#62; 2600mAh Battery. (Under Rs 20000 Xolo Q3000 ships with 4000mAh Battery ) =&#62; Display - 720 x 1280 pixels, 5.25 inches (~280 ppi pixel density) is far better than the original Grand shipped last year,still not the best you can get for the price. Display is highly reflective and the viewing angles are not the best. =&#62; Performance - The performance of the device is the same as you can get on the under Rs15000 Moto G. This has the same processor-gpu combination and the gaming performance is quite good.You may hit some lags when playing high end HD games though. 1.5GB of Ram makes multitasking a breeze. =&#62; 8GB of internal storage of which 5.7 GB is user accessible.

Since this has the heavy Touchwiz UI on top of Android 4.3,occasionally you are gonna face with some lags here and there. Apart from that,the device performs really well.  When looking at other devices with same specs, Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 is a little overprized,but for this extra money you are paying, you get more software features like multi-window.  Mircomax Canvas Knight which comes with an octa core processor,2GB ram etc is only priced under Rs 20000 which makes it a better grab than this.If you are ok with a device with no micro sdcard slot and an average camera, cheaper Moto G is a great buy.

Don't use third party music players like player pro or poweramp as the stock music player is best.

Now beyond this i don't want some torture tests as i have installed all the useful applications i need.

The dual SIM phone consist of 1.2 Ghz dual core processor, 512 MB RAM, 4 GB disk space, Android JellyBean 4.2.2, few XOLO branded apps including readymade themes code named X-Themes.  Even though the phone has 4 GB of internal storage, only 1.2 GB is usable, which means Android Jelly Bean consumes more disk space. However, you can expand the memory to 32 GB using Micro SD card.  XOLO A500S IPS, which I am using it for last 7 months will take few minutes to boot up initially. Moreover, I didn't notice any abnormal heat during charging and when playing games. The phone is very much light weight and doesn&#8217;t feel heavy for your pockets.  The thickness of XOLO A500S IPS is less when compared to other competing phones and games such as Temple Run, Subway surfers, Asphalt works fine and fast. The device has got a great non slippery back panel. The functionality of primary and secondary cameras is average similar to that of other similar category phones.  The display of the phone is not that much good despite IPS screen as it is too reflective when placed under light. I had to position it in a particular angle to work with the phone. Moreover, I didn&#8217;t like the placement of lock and volume buttons. This is because if you lock the phone then volume button will also be pressed unless you take care of it.  I am very much disappointed with the quality of speakers. I must say that speaker is not audible when the phone is placed on the desk. However, the volume is better when the phone is kept on the hand.  The default ringtones included with the phone are not audible. If you place XOLO A500S IPS and switch on the TV or some other audible stuff then you will not be able to clearly hear the ringtone. The sound is audible only if phone is placed on the same room.  I was surprised when I saw blue screen of death with some unknown commands after one week of purchase. The phone worked properly only when I took the battery out and placed it after a minute.  I found that the length of XOLO A500S IPS is big when compared with other 4 inch phones.  The battery backup of the device is average and cannot be said to be great. I am not a heavy user and the battery lasted around 2 days when used without Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. However, if you play games and make use of internet you will have to charge the phone once every day.  I also noticed that if I didn't charge the battery for long time you will have to take the battery out and place it again. I had done this once when the phone behaved abnormally during charging.  The phone ships with one screen guard affixed to it besides headphone, USB charger and a small pocket manual. I would suggest the manufacturer to include a small note that the screen guard has already been affixed to the phone so that users will not tamper with the other screen guard inside the package.  If you want a basic light weight Android phone then XOLO A500S IPS is an excellent choice. I really don't know about the quality of service centres but I will be happy as long as the device works fine. The device can also be used as a mini tablet for e-mail checking, browsing and listening to mild music on the go.  XOLO A500S IPS is good but the price is fluctuating on Amazon.in. Sometimes, you will see 4999 but sometimes 5999. The price of the phone should be around 4000 because we can easily purchase a 5 inch phone for Rs 5000 price range.

With the Galaxy Alpha, the metal body was introduced in Samsung phones but the back was still made of plastic. But A series features full unibody design which gives the phone a sturdy feel(sturdy yet not premium). The RAM is plenty for a phone but what seems to be a point of concern here is the processor, which is comparable to the processors of a few android wear(Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53). What that means is, that while the phone feels snappy in daily tasks, it's exhibits a lacklustre performance in resource hogging tasks like gaming. A great new feature is that the micro SD card slot doubles as a sim card slot to make the phone dual sim. but that features compromises expandable memory.So to sum it up -  Pros- 1. Sturdy build 2. 2gb RAM 3. Interchangeable micro SD(Up to 64GB)/dual sim card slot 4. Nice camera(13 MP rear and 5 MP front), with features like wide frame selfies and animated gif selfies 5. Super slim(6.7mm) 6. Corning Gorilla Glass 4 7. Battery lasts a day no issue, though it is a 2300(Li-Ion) mAh battery. This is because both the screen and the processor are not as powerful so they could do well with less juice.  Cons- 1. Mediocre screen(720p screen in year 2015!! Though it's 294 ppi and it's still difficult to spot pixels from a practical distance in 720p screen, still higher resolution produces more vivid and sharp images, though it is more taxing on the battery, which becomes somewhat significant here as the battery is less powerful) 2. Less powerful processor(Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53) 3. Sound is not good, Samsung should have put the speakers on the side rather than on the back. 4. OTG not supported 5. Android 4.4.4 out of the box(an update may be on its way) 6. Metal back is prone to scratches 7. High price for the specifications  Bottomline This phone has almost the same specifications as Lenovo A6000 but is more costly. The sturdy build and slim form factor makes the phone feel good in hand, but still lacks a premium touch. The camera is good and the comparable brother is Galaxy S5, except for the fact that this phone is 1.2 GHz quad while S5 has 2.5 GHz quad core processor. So, while this phone is launched recently, still it would be a better choice to stretch the budget a little bit and buy the S5, as this phone brings nothing exceptionally appealing to the table except for a sturdy design and a undue price."], ["5.0", "Superlative Phone!", "asheshthedrummer", "Awesome build quality.

Rear camera is really very bad in medium or low light and fine only in very good daylight not nighttime even if it has very good light.. Front Camera cant even be compared to a VGA camera tats how it is.. So if u r into a camera phone or a phone wit normal camera option, i wont suggest this phone.. Better forget the camera option if u r buying this phone..  2.It does have network connection problems.. It shows apps like 'Whatsapp' cant connect repeatedly unless i open it, den only i can receive the messages that were sent back like 2 days ago even the 3G connection is \"on\" for 24/7..  3.Another problem tat should be taken care of is the sound quality tat gets drastically reduced when calling others and cant even hear the other persons voice properly n i had to use loudspeaker only to hear the voice..  4.On the very first day, battery withstanded upto 7 hours even though i didnt use the apps or any other things.. Battery usage after 2 days using apps and others cant even withstand 4 or 5 hours.. Normal usage gives the battery upto 7 or 8 hours at the max..  5.Phone sometimes lags.. i read so many reviews in here and other websites saying that this phone doesnt lag but i had that rough experience after 4 days.. Sometimes when u simultaneously go through apps, u might get this wilder experience and also when u r playing games like 'Subway Surfer' or 'Temple Run' or any other equal games..  6.When transferring files via bluetooth, i experienced that not more than 3 files cant be transferred to other devices at a time and the bluetooth connection gets closed after that automatically.. i tried multiple times with different phones but got the same result..

Awesome !!", "mac", "# Main Highlights 1) 4200mAh Battery - Can easily last 2 days of very heavy usage. 2) Quadcore - Mtk6582M processor 3) 1 GB Ram 4) Android 4.2 Jellybean. (Update : M2 is gonna get Kitkat update.)  4200mAh battery is unheard in a device shipping at this price range. The other 2 handsets that ships with similar battery are Lenovo P780 and Xolo Q3000,but both are priced much higher than this. Due to the huge battery it needs to accommodate,the device is bulky, and a little heavier than other smartphones. The display is a 5 inch one with a resolution of 480 x 854 pixels,which is not that great,but OK. The viewing angles are also not that great. The processor/gpu combination is powerful enough to play many of the games without much issues and the jellybean on board runs smooth. Gionee has opted to ship this with a custom UI instead of Android stock UI.  # Some Misc Info This is a dual sim phone - One is the normal sim slot, while the other is a micro sim slot. OTG is not supported Sensors on board - Accelerometer,Magnetic Sensor,Light Sensor,Proximity Sensor,Orientation sensors.

As his first smartphone, and knowing his stubby fingers and tendency to drop things, I wanted something that was large-screened and sturdy.  Another requirement was good battery life as I could see my dad not bothering to charge his phone every single day.  This phone has turned out to be an excellent purchase seeing as one charge lasts him 2 days easily, it's very easy to use, doesn't lag whatsoever, doesn't do any funny things, the screen is big which makes typing for him easy, and the phone, though heavy, feels solid in hand which is reassuring.  I don't think I could have found a better phone than this for my dad and though I was initially skeptical about how my dad would accept it, he absolutely loves it and is inseparable from it.  The cameras though high in megapixels aren't great but that's not a problem for us since my dad is not fond of taking pics anyway. If you're looking for a great camera, you should look elsewhere.  But if any of you is looking for a phone that you can simply buy and forget and which will keep serving you like a reliable workhorse, I suggest you go for this one.  And if you are also aiming to help your father get into the smartphone space, you probably won't find a better place to start.

Roy \"fakir73\"", "I have all three phones concurrently and would like give an review based on my experience with all three devices but focusing on the Passport primarily. When they tell you that the Passport is a productivity machine I have to agree with the categorization. The Hub is awesome I have all my mail accounts including WhatsApp, Linked, Facebook, Instagram (Igrann Pro) ,google chat, etc. I hear people say is that not an information overload on the Hub? The answer is actually NO this is because you can choose to see what is always displayed and accounts that are displayed when you select them.  Mail -- is butter smooth I cannot say how much better it is than the Gmail app on the HTC M8 or the Mail app on the iPhone 6. The issue I have with Gmail on the HTC(android in general) is that if you have non Gmail accounts you have to rely on the Mail app which is  pretty poor and laggy. Mail on IOS 8.xx is an improvement but you still get \"the message cannot download at this time\" but it does have some nifty features like recognising tracking numbers and dates for appointments etc. The testament of how good the Hub is that even when I in from of my computer I look to reply to emails using my Passport (also the keyboard has a part to play here). The email on the BB is clear and I actually am able to read some reports that I get instead of skimming them as I do both on the M8 and the iPhone 6,This for me is priceless.  The passport is a couple of evolutions ahead of the competition  Other Messaging - Here again while the fact that whatsapp on iPhone and Android are able to compress large videos before sending across the BB 10.3 Whatsapp cannot/does not. This might be a showstopper for some for others. Here I would give the competition the advantage though caveat it that you don't have a single point of integration as the Hub (Snowball for Android is trying to do the same) and No notifications do not count in the integrated hub  Typing - I am pretty fast on the virtual keyboards yet I must say typing on the Passport is pure joy. For all you road warriors its like typing on an IBM Thinkpad after one of those ultraportable laptops you appreciate the key travel and the tactile feel of the keys   App notifications - Here both the M8 and the iPhone 6 are far ahead and I am not sure whether BB10.xx will catch up anytime soon  Apps - This the 800 pound gorilla in the room. Spoiler alert IOS8 wins hands down. The passports implementation of Android 4.4.3 is not ready for the big time yet. I have had some lag performance and crashes and random errors including QNXLauncher is not something or the other do you want to shut it down. I will give a list of apps that I use that work on the device, but all in all it is a step in the right direction but a long way to go still.So the progression from IOS to BB 10.3 is a follows 80% of apps I use on IOS are there on Android 70% of those that are on Android work on bb 10.3 so from IOS to BB 10.3 your app universe shrinks by 40-45%. Is it bad? not really . Is it ideal? Not really. Apps that I Use and work are as follows (not Exhaustive but what I use) a)Salesforce Classic (better than the native connect to salesforce) b) Engadget c)Flipboard(a bit troublesome sometimes but generally works) d) Soundhound (again better than native) e) Spotify ( yes works great) f)Guardian,Wsj (again a hit or miss and crashes or freezes often) g) Swarm (Not foursquare),Zomato h) Pininterest i)Roku j)Goal.com k)Todoist l)Moneycontrol,Bloomberg,FT,ET,TOI(again better than Native) m) Connect for Garmin (syncs my Vivofit), Whitings ,Training Peaks n) Luminosity(some scaling issues) ,Duolingo  Apps that I have not been able to get to work a) Onenote b)Viber c) Zygna Poker, Asphalt 7 d) Bubble Ds  BB Assistant - This is slow but I will say awesome even better that Siri (but slower ) One example will highlight this \"I fee like eating a Kebab\" the assistant will take some time but come back with a list of food places with kebab in them where as Siri says \"Sorry I can't look for Restaurants in India\" common  Maps - not as straight forward as Google but not bad and I have side loaded google maps (no google play support so it won't remember your searches) otherwise works quite well,  but Nokia Here maps did not work when side loaded  Battery - I am not so sure yet on this as I do need to currently charge it every day and that could be because I am trying a lot on it everyday. So I will reserve comment on it other than it is better than an M8  Screen - here I feel the M8 might be the best but I love the form factor and clarity and brightness of the screen even at 50% brightness  4g or LTE - this is another reason my review gave it a notch down as I am not happy that the Passport does not support the 2300MHz band in India. Also I have forced 3G selection but it is ( for the new antenna tech and jargon) as good as either my M8 or iPhone 6 maybe a software update will sort this out  Looks - honestly people find the phone strange and I introduce it as the Blackberry TV and some people even believe it. I don't care.  So all in all I give it a 4 Stars because it is my goto phone for work and some play but I carry an iPhone 6 around in the evenings. This is neither practical or feasible for everyone so make your own decisions but for me the passport is here to stay"], ["5.0", "Passport to Productivity!", "Shatrugan J.", "The first thing you notice is that this isn't your usual Rectangular shaped screen.. its a Square Display measured at 4.5\" which is Bigg!!  ~* The large display offers an uncompromising experience for viewing content, reading & editing word & excel documents, using maps, managing email and browsing the web. *~  The display is an IPS LCD screen with super high resolutions of 1440 x 1440 pixels on screen and a Pixel Density of 454ppi that beats even the new iPhone 6 or your nexus5.. it also has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Protection to secure that beautiful display!

The pure view of lumias is unbeatable. Miss that. * out of 32gb given to the phone, 10gb is taken by the OS itself. But yaa it gives u an option of the mem card.

It's a Genius Phone!!", "Shashikant Iyengar", "Big, awkward, very productive, massive battery, unique, eye catching, excellent for seeing spreadsheets.  These are the few thoughts I have about the new BlackBerry  Passport.  When I opened the box I thought \"My god! How am I going to carry this Thing? Though I had taken out my tape measure to see how big it would be on reading the specs I was still shocked on actually seeing it!  Slowly as I started using it I got used to this mammoth phone. Setting up this mobile was a breeze.  The key board though is different from the BlackBerry Curve I am used to. A new learning curve here.  But a week on I am loving it. This phone slips easily in the upper shirt Pocket (though it's made for CEOs wearing a suit). It can be easily carried and I believe that this should not deter us in using this new form factor.  It's a pleasure in using this mobile to see spreadsheets. You can really Work Wide with the BlackBerry passport. Seeing PPT is also a pleasure. As it has a 3gb RAM big Excel sheets can be opened in a jiffy.   Using blackberry for mails and sms was always excellent and the same holds true for BlackBerry passport also.  The concept is HUB is unique and all those using their mobile for business purposes will find this concept Fantastic!!  As usual the notification LED light is the highlight of BlackBerry.  The massive internal memory of 32gb with the option of inserting 128 gb micro SD is the big plus point for storage for those on the go.  As mentioned by all in many reviews you will have to use both the hands. One hand will not do. Though some of the operations are possible with a little practice. Using this new keyboard requires a bit of practice. But you will love it once you get used to it.  This mobile is also useful for those having Telecons  frequently. You can dial and minimise the dial up interface. You can at the same time open up spreadsheets, PPTs etc and keep participating in the conference with earphones connected. Everything can be easily minimised and accessed on the screen.  The voice clarity is excellent. You will find it a bit difficult in holding this phone initially while speaking but will get used to it.  Some Dos and Don'ts:  When speaking you will have to hold the phone in such a way that the small speaker is exactly touching the ears. If not placed properly (since its a large phone) the voice clarity may not be good. But if placed properly then the clarity is excellent  You have to download WPS office or Office suit pro as the pre- installed 'Docs to go' does not have the filter options for excel sheets. Hope Microsoft offers the MS office free for BlackBerry also as they are for Android and iOS now.  DO not sync the Hotmail address book. This creates Multiple duplicate entries and the address book slows down massively. Appears to be a Hotmail error. I had to manually delete the entire address book and transfer the address book from my BlackBerry Curve using the Bluetooth. After doing this the problem got resolved.  Security remains a largely compromised area with many mobiles. In today's world we are prone to using mobile devices for online shopping and banking services. Credit cards are used. How can we then ignore the security offered by BlackBerry? All the more the most ignored aspect is built strongly in BlackBerry devices.  What the OS 10 misses out is the facility to forward sms as mail or mail as sms which is available in older OS.  For seeing the images in mail you have to click a small arrow at the right side of the page. A bit irritating. Maybe there is a way out.  BlackBerry passport has OTG facility. A feature less written about. An excellent phone for those on the move and also those who use their phones for mails / sms.  This device is not for playing junk games like candy crush or subway surfer.   The massive battery lasts for 1.5 to 2 days on average use. For me only 70% gets used each day on average to heavy use.

It's a genius phone."], ["4.0", "A productivity tool with hub as a core!", "Rachit Desai", "Hub is the core and more powerful feature of blackberry.

Battery is also much better than iPhones of this world. Truly a productivity tool. Yes, screen gives a very different and amazing readability; especially for apps like Twitter and Facebook and likes.

USP of My Blackberry Passport Which I found after hands-on with the device are as: 1. Build Quality: it is really Premium and build solidly with steel frame and well finished, so it looks & fell very premium one. 2. Innovative Keyboard: I am fan of this as need to write lot of messages, email's and chatting on Whatsapp and BBM, initially you need to learn a little but it is simple and easy, it is very fast and accurate as well. 3. Screen: Screen is very Sharp, pixel density is QHD (1440X1440), 4.5 Inch Square, very useful for viewing messages, emails & other stuff like pictures, webpages etc. 4. Robust Hardware: Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 Processor 2.2GHz, 3GB LP DDR-3 RAM, 4G Enable, 13MP OIS Front Camera, 4.5 Inch Square Screen 453dpi with Gorilla Glass 3. 5. CAMERA: I am very pleased with the camera quality, it is 13MP with OIS, pictures are very sharp, vivid and colors are very natural, it is first time I found in any blackberry device. 6. Battery: Hats-off to blackberry for such huge battery(3450Mah) it makes my life simpler, no to charge on daily. 7. Blackberry OS 10.3: Blackberry OS 10.3 is refined now having all missing features which I want like easy delete of emails in one go, UI Changes are looks cool, endless app in one folder, Increase in application via Amazon app store, Blackberry blend, Blackberry Assistant, it is totally overhauled now.  I am very happy with Blackberry Passport and I am recommended this device for all who are looking for a device for Serious Mobility (it is for all who want to check email, play games, check pics, webpages, messages, communicate fast, see videos), it is one solution and very very Innovate and very solidly build with all premium material.

If this phone falls in budget then must go for it."], ["1.0", "Pathetic after sales support from Sony !!", "Ranjan Kumar Mohapatra", "When Sony Xperia Z1 released I was one of the first customers to buy the handset from Flipkart with lot of excitement...But trust me, I am experiencing pathetic customer service from the customer care and service center department.  Sony being a worldwide brand for electronics and home appliances, every customer expects to get prompt and appropriate service for their products, but in my case I failed to receive satisfactory service for a premium product like Xperia Z1&#8230;..  1. On 24th December when I woke up in the morning I saw my Xperia Z1 display having a crack from inside the cabinet.. There was no damage on the external glass but however, the display had cracked from inside.. A single scratch cannot be seen from the external where the display has cracked&#8230;.  2. In my case the local service center people are asking me to pay 18,000+ rupees to replace my handset completely instead of replacing the display although my handset is under warranty and the display had also cracked on it's own from inside. There is no sign of external damage on the screen.  3. Sony Customer Care executives and Sony Service Center are not well trained and they do not understand customer grievances. They are least bothered about the customer satisfaction and only think of ways to extract more money from the customer. Nobody bothered to give me a callback to update me about the status. I had to keep following up with the customer care helpline as well as the Sony Service Center. I know few acquaintances who had similar experience with Service Center, Bhubaneswar.  4. My handset contained some photographs in the internal storage with my father who died this year and that was more valuable to me. I requested the service center to take the backup of my phone but they refused that it cannot be done as display is cracked .If I can do the data backup after exploring the internet for few hours then why can't the technicians employed by Sony do the same ??? Aren't they qualified enough???  5. While I handed over the handset to the service center there was a small area of damage to the display but when I received the handset from them the area of damage had increased significantly.. I have the photographs available with me..  6. I had heard that Sony Xperia Z1 is a flagship model and during service period the service center provides a temporary handset but in my case no temporary handset was also issued to me.  7. After sending an email to Sony Senior Management in India Sony Head Office Support team sent an email stating I have to pay 50% of MRP for refurbished handset without accessories and 80% of MRP (Rs 28,500/-) for fresh handset without accessories&#8230;.. Prices offered by local Sony Service Center and head office vary significantly which proves there is no baseline price&#8230; Whatever happens to your handset Sony people will simply ask you to pay another 20k -30k instead of replacing the faulty equipment&#8230;  It&#8217;s really frustrating as Sony Customer Service people are asking me to pay another 28k for the handset which is under warranty and the screen has also cracked on its own due to faulty design/bad quality equipment being used.  Trust me guys the service being offered by Samsung for Galaxy S4 which is a comparable model with Z1 is much better than Sony&#8230; Sony is having the worst after sales service&#8230; I would like to request everyone not to go by brand instead buy the products having better after sales service to make your life hassle free&#8230;&#8230;"], ["2.0", "Overheating and self cracking", "Shubhangi Pandey", "Its been only one month and one day i kept it inside drawer-stable and steady positioned.....one hour later I find back panel having multiple cracks on it.

Actually we bought 3 phones on a same day. One for myself (Xperia z2), one for my sister (Galaxy s5) and one for my elder brother (Note 3). P.S. - I used to own Samsung Note 2 before buying this.  So basically I am going to compare these three devices.  Display - Display on note 3 or S5 is absolutely magnificent but having said that the wider range of colors that z2's display produces is far beyond the capabilities of any other phone in the market right now. Closest rival might be Xperia Z ultra, Note 3 and S5.  z2 wins the battle here. I could not believe the color reproduction that z2 is able to deliver. Amazing!!!  Built Quality / Looks - Again absolutely no contest here. Z2 wins it hands down. The built quality and the looks on this device is incomparable to plastic(ee) samsung or LG's.  Note 3 is second and s5 distant third. (Back panel of s5 is ugly.)  Sound - Z2 wins. Speaker are loder and clearer to both Note 3 and s5. (If you want better speaker go for HTC one which is better than any other phone in the market)  Speed : Again there's not a lot of difference there, but Indian version of both note 3 and S5 uses Samsung's own CHEAPset (pun intended) where as Sony uses powerful snapdragon. There's not a lot of difference but snapdragon handles everything better.  Camera : Many people complaining and claiming themselves to be professional photographers are either stupid or simply doesn't own this phone. All the phones captures great images.  Calling : Here note 3 wins. Sound of calls on note 3 and even s5 is superior to z2. Not only that but while talking to someone on this phone the voice of the person from the other end can be heard by people around you. I don't know why but for 50k phone this is a HUGE let down.  Games : Again equally good on all of them.  Music : Walkman provided by Sony is better than any music player. z2 wins.  Interface : Both Note 3 and s5 lags a bit due to sluggish touch-wiz (Even i had same problem with note 2). Sony's interface is cleaner and premium. (Though it all come to personal preference and may be I got bugged to touch-wiz after using back to back Samsung devices.) One thing I hate about Sony is on screen home, menu and  back button.  Handling : All of them are quite comfortable to handle but Z2 feels premium while note 3 feels more comfortable even though it has the biggest display of the 3.  Final Verdict : To be very honest both my brother and sister and jealous of my phone. And they admitted that my (z2) is better than their phones. So go for it if you have no problem with the price and you don't mind cleaning fingerprint marks on your phone after frequent intervals."], ["2.0", "Phone working intermittently with glitches that make me doubt", "Aditya", "The phone arrived in good condition & box & accessories. But functioning has been doubtful at times.. It works fine many times & it acts weird & lags & auto-uses touchscreen sometimes. 1. Sometimes.. The touchscreen changes the reaction to extreme unwanted functions. eg - I am pressing lowest end of screen & it opens options as if i touch right top of screen. Next second, it auto types words with letters I m not touching or sometimes not even wanting to type. So sometimes it also ends up deleting stuff i want. I have to restart the phone & then usually this stops & the phone works barely normal again. Its unpredictable. 2. The phone network just doesnt respond well many times.. For few days I thought this might be my network issue, but then I have a year old Tablet with same network which works fine at the same locations or times. Sometimes the Z2 just doesnt connect well to 3G & switches alternatively to 2G at random moments (usually when 3G is urgently needed) & sometimes the network just goes blank completely (no 3G no 2G no network at all). Considering that I ve paid to get the best mobile in the market, I feel I have got a so-so mobile which only works perfect most times & acts weird the few times I need it to work well. Quite a smart phone, has mood swings I guess!  Though I dont know if its Sony or Amazon to answer, I dont really think Sony has ever had such weird issues (I ve always been a sony user & this is not the first Z series in my household).  I think I might stay OFF amazon & this seller... Coz my usual trusted Flpkrt has never yielded me such problems in years."], ["5.0", "Fantastic phone. Nothing can beat Xperia flagship", "KRDAVALA", "Fantastic phone. Nothing can beat Xperia flagship. Been using for 6 months. Got lollipop update as well."], ["3.6", "Its only for those who love to splurgge on show off", "Alok Shukla", "Now it has been quite sometime that i have bought this phone from Amazon. Since I was terribly disappointed with my previous Sony phone (Xperia X10 - First 4 inch android phone in the market, bought it at launch), This time I lowered down my expectations a lot and did a lot of research on the product before buying it. But Alas, I guess now reviews are also not to be trusted. No doubt what they said was right - but what they hid was crucial. So all the gimmicks about it are pretty useless . 1. Looks - Certainly killer looks. That is when it is on the table, and with the cover. The cover acts as cleaner by regular wiping off the smudges from the glossy screen. I tried using it without the cover, and within a hour it looked like as if i picked it up from a dustbin. No exaggerations here, just forget using it without cover. 2. Speaking of cover, the cover is pretty nice, the only problem is it is awkward to put in the charger with the cover on. The position of charging port is on the inside edge of the phone.means, you have to keep it open while charging. Pretty ugly huh. 3. Also, cover makes it next to impossible one had operation, which i prefer. I am 6.1 feet tall with fairly large hands than most ppl with lesser height, i didn't thought it will be a problem. well it is. The screen size make it a bit difficult. Thought it is manageable without cover. 4. Great part - the screen. Awesome.brilliant. Mind blowing.superb. a treat in itself, if you are watching videos or even movies on the go. but then, 5.2 inch screen is too small.. a tablet would be better. 5. Speakers - for a phone call, very good speakers/mic (not external ones). But when listening to music/vedios or phone calls in speaker mode.. almost inaudible voice, unless there is a pin drop silence. Earphones provided along are useless quality, you will feel ashamed using the in public with this phone. I couldn't use my regular headphones with the phone. It is not supported, i tried three different headsets. Guess Sony still wants me to spend another 10,000 bucks on headphones. 6. Camera - I dont know what I should say about it. i am a photography enthusiast, and usually take shots from my Canon 7D DSLR, which is irreplaceable but very heavy to carry around all the time. The sole reason i bought this phone was the reviews I got for the camera. I was disappointed would be an understatement. It is certainly a good camera when you compare with micromax or lava, but then those are not 50000 Rs phones. Here are the reasons -   - Average quality pics in auto mode. every Nokia phone i used had a better quality.   - Low quality night shots.   - Much touted time shift videos or other photographic effect are useless, as they are just software apps. you can do better on you laptop, and practically, you can not edit your pics on phone.. and Video editing is close to impossible. if you are any serious about it. Time shift mode doesn't take more frames per second, but only allows you to delete certain frames to create illusions.   -  4K camcorder -  Seriously? I wont comment on this. overall - Camera feature are nice for a expensive toy, but if you are any serious about photography - take your pocket camera with you. This isn't a replacement. now biggest issue with the camera - This phone is a powerhouse phone, with hardware on steroids.Super fast processing. but then, that is the problem. It generates heat. lots of it. a few minutes of temple run increases the back side temperature in high forties. It is well known that camera sensors are very sensitive to heat (Thats why on every camera manual it is written not to leave it in direct sunlight for extended period.) This is the biggest issue with the phone. It is fast, but if i use it for gaming, i will burn off the sensor. if i don't, what is the use of 3 GB ram and a super fast processor with high end graphics?  7. the smart band given with it is pretty useless. used it for two weeks, then realized that captured data is useless. The only good thing about it is, it vibrates if you leave you phone and walk away almost 5 meters. Saves your phone from getting lost. Vibrates for incoming calls, good when phone is in back pack. otherwise.. its a hassle.  8.Waterproofing features -  didn't dare to try.  Overall verdict - The phone isn't a bad phone. but set your expectation right. If you think, that by spending 50 K you will get a music player, camera, video player, phone and a gaming device in one body, then you are right. But none of these functions will be good for practical use, other than occasional times when you want to click that selfie. it is just like an expensive toy for fun - nothing serious. Also, all other high end features, like screen mirroring, wi-fi direct, NFC etc will require you to buy more gadgets to be able to use them - mostly from Sony itself. So unless you are going to spend close to 2 lacs on all these devices, these features are pretty much useless for you. Then why bother about these??? better buy a 20 K phone with decent features than a 50 k phone with top end features -  but then I do it all the time..coz i like to show off my latest gadget.. only for the sake of it :)"], ["4.0", "Good phone, stupid bundle.", "Pranay", "The phone is excellent as such I just wish they gave the noise cancellation ear phones and magnetic dock like they do in other countries instead of this useless smart band.

Cons:- Although there r very little cons,but here are some:- 1.Heating-Yes,it's one of those very common problems those people talk about,but then,it also takes very little time to cool down.But still,if users get problems,I hardly recommend them 2 install clean master from play store as I have done. 2.Battery-Yes,it sucks,and also,its d only and biggest letdown of dis device. 3.Although its a 2gb ram phone,I hardly get 1gb of ram free,but as I said earlier,games and apps do not lag at all. 4.The camera sucks in night time as told earlier and d flash is also no gud!

On paper its shows lots of strength but in real world struggles a lot. 2 GB of ram is useless when operating system is not smooth. 13 MP camera produce too much noise and struggle to focus"], ["4.0", "Canvas nitro", "JACK", "Notably, the only difference between the Canvas Nitro (A310) and Canvas Nitro (A311) is that the latter includes 16GB of inbuilt storage. Other specifications of the new smartphone are identical to the original Canvas Nitro (A310).  Look and feel Our instant reaction on holding the Micromax Canvas Nitro, with its weight of 146g, was that it felt heavier than the other options in this price range. The rear of the Micromax Canvas Nitro looks quite similar to that of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with its faux stitched-leather finish. The front is mostly uninspiring with the 5-inch screen taking up most of the real estate. In fact, the phone on the whole looks rather tepid and does nothing to capture attention.  Specifications and software Micromax has fitted the Canvas Nitro with the octa-core Mediatek MT6592 processor which is clocked at 1.7GHz and has an integrated Mali-450 GPU. The Canvas Nitro also features 2GB of RAM. Out of the 8GB of internal storage space, only 5.68GB is available for users but you can expand this by up to 32GB using a microSD card.  The phone accepts two Micro-SIM cards and they connect to the 850/ 900/ 1800/ 1900/ 2100 network bands. It can also connect to Wi-Fi networks and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. A 2500mAh battery provides the juice for the device. The 5-inch 720p display is great for the most part with vibrant colours and good viewing angles, but things go downhill when viewed under direct sunlight. The screen is very reflective and we had a difficult time trying to use this phone because of this.  Micromax has tweaked the software to add a few additional features which have been mostly borrowed from Samsung's Touchwiz and HTC's Sense UI. For starters, Micromax adds a QuickLook page to the left of the primary homescreen. QuickLook is nothing but Micromax's attempt to emulate HTC's BlinkFeed which itself is based on Flipboard. One more swipe from the QuickLook page shows the settings where one can choose which topics the feed displays. One can also add Facebook and Twitter accounts so that they can reflect in the feed. However, there is no way to add feeds from specific websites. Moreover, there is a weird blue tint to the background of text when any article is opened, making it rather difficult to read.  The lockscreen has a simple swipe-up gesture, and available notifications are displayed on a red band. Some of the other software tweaks include the ability to pause video playback when the user looks away, which is a direct lift of Samsung's 'Smart Pause' feature. It works most of the time, if ambient lighting is good enough.  Camera The 13-megapixel camera on the Micromax Canvas Nitro is the perfect example of why the megapixel count doesn't matter. The lens and sensor of this phone clearly don't do it any justice. As a result when seen at actual size, it is quite evident that captured photos lack a lot of details. If viewed closely one can observe a blue tint to photographs which means that the white balance is off. In low light, the camera failed to capture any detail whatsoever. The only upside is that the camera can focus and shoot images really fast.  Captured video is recorded in .3gpp format for some reason and the quality is really bad. The camera couldn't stay focused on any subject, and video was just very dim. Surprisingly, the fixed-focus 5-megapixel front camera can capture decent images but it is not as good as the one on the Sony Xperia C3 Dual  Micromax has added a camera widget to one of the home screens, which directly lets a user access some of the camera's many modes. The selfie mode is self-explanatory. Frontback mode takes pictures with both cameras and shows them in splits creen. We fail to understand the novelty of this mode and think that Micromax could have stuck to the tried-and-tested picture-in-picture format used by other smartphone companies. There is a Stable mode in which a reading like a heart rate monitor moves on top of the screen to show you when the device is stable enough for shooting. The camera app by itself provides a lot of cool options like saying the word 'cheese' to capture an image (which didn't work most of the time). Also, there are a few manual controls as well. But hiding often-used modes like HDR deep in the settings menu is rather annoying.  Performance We didn't face any hiccups while using the Micromax Canvas Nitro every day. It has smooth transitions and works quite well. It is a great smartphone experience. We even tried high-end games like Asphalt 8 and Dead Trigger 2, and we didn't face any lag whatsoever.  The Canvas Nitro played all the heavily encoded videos we threw at it without any hassles. The loudspeaker is not too loud and moreover it distorts at high volumes. The bundled earphones will serve the purpose for most people, which is a good thing. The call quality is really good and the sound on both ends of the call was crystal clear.  We were completely floored at the battery performance of the Canvas Nitro. It managed to play video in a loop for 16 hours and 9 minutes before it died on us. This is exceptional battery life and this one performance stat alone is enough to sway a lot of buyers in the favour of this phone."], ["4.0", "Could have been a 5 STARRER!", "Srikanth Matrubai", "The phone is worth every penny for the price.

User Interface & Screen resolution is awesome it gives you very rich and branded feel. Screen size is also perfect 5.5&#34;. With adding an update to 816G of Octacore processor htc has done perfect update in Desire 816 so that your phone never hang like Samsung phones. Internal memory is awesome.

Negatives:- First thing to improve is the touch of its Keyboard. Sometimes you will have to press it many a times still it wont appear. Specially corner keyboard letters like 'a' & 'l'. Secondly Camera pixel is only 8mp & 4mp whereas htc claims it to be 13mp & 5mp on box. Battery backup is also good it may last around 1.5 to 2 days.Also dont get confused by other users comments there is no model like 816G+ there is only 816G.

CONS:  i)Tizen Store: Tizen Store is a place of wastes. I can't find any descent photo editing app there. Only WhatsApp available. Hike , We Chat and other messengers are missing. Not even that, we can not use WhatsApp without installing an another app called 'ACL' This ACL occupies almost 155mb on internal storage.  ii) Hanging Problem: Hangs while playing game or some high resolution videos.  iii) Back Cover: Back Cover attracts dust easily.  iv) MP3 Player: Although sound is good, but there is lack of equalizer.  v) GPS: Gps is too slow(or useless) to use. I cannot find my location after waiting for 15 minutes.  vi) Ultra Power Saving Mode: this is the main attraction of this device. Ultra Power Saving Mode is nothing but a marketing gimmick. Cause, by enabling this we can not explore all features. This APP saves power with a simple UI and giving permission to access limited Apps. In any phone we can save power by this process.

{"url": "http://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-E5-Black/dp/B00SF8UNE2", "reviews": [["3.7", "Absolutely go for it.", "Snigdhodeep Kundu", "I have been using this phone for over two months now. To start, at around 16k, this is an awesome phone. Some of its features are absolutely top drawer when compared to other phones in this price range. 1. The cameras (both front and back) are brilliant. Some very clever features have been added to the stock camera app which eliminates the need of installing any other camera app. There is a gesture recognition feature for the front camera which makes it a real joy to use and gives clear, steady and shake-free selfies as you dont need to tap or click anywhere on the phone to take the pic. It also has a face-tweeking feature which I found real fun to use. As far as the basic parameters are concerned, it takes really good low light pictures, the flash responds well even in complete darkness. It has a good enough zoom and the photos hold out well and dont look granular even when zoomed to a large extent in computer. 2. Super AMOLED display is stunning, and at this price, its a great addition. 5-inch screen gives great output for both still images and videos. I am not a keen gamer, so cant say much about its rendering of high end games, though games like Temple Run 2 run smoothly. 3. 1.2 GHz processor works fine and I have not experienced any lag till now. I am a big app addict and love to keep loads of apps installed in my phone and the speed is perfectly fine. 4. The phone is very sleek and its form factor feels better compared to Galaxy S3 or S4. Those who have not used  a 5 inch screen before might find it a little difficult to handle initially but its superb display makes it worthwhile. 5. There are a few very good features in the phone which you wont find in any other phone like the split- screen display which lets you use two apps simultaneously. It has a UPS (ultra power saving) mode which which turns the phone into a black and white one and greatly enhances battery life. It also has screen mirroring which gives direct output from phone to TV. 6. There are a lot of pre-installed apps by Google and Samsung which cant be deleted, which is a a bit annoying. 7. There is a catch in the dual SIM feature as there is no different slot for memory stick and one of the SIM slot doubles up as a memory stick slot. So effectively, you can use either two SIM cards or one SIM and one memory stick at a time, though 16 GB  internal memory, of which around 12 GB is usable, is enough for keeping quite a few apps, songs, videos and games and I didnt feel the need to have extra memory. 8. Battery performance is ok, lasts almost for a day with average internet usage. Though I feel, they could have given a little more than 2400mAh, considering that it has a 5-inch display and its multi tasking features. 9. Volume rocker is on the left side of the display which makes it a little clumsy to handle if you are using a flip cover.  Overall, a very good buy at this range. Though, I have to admit at all Samsung phones look the same but you get the &#34;Samsung&#34; reliability and a good service network.  P.S-  I got a 2400 INR cash back from Paytm with the phone, which was really useful.

Well, I already have Huawei Honor 6 and I needed another phone for my Office number. After much research, I zeroed in Intex Aqua Power Plus. I had my apprehensions, but took the plunge.  Positives: - BATTERY BATTERY BATTERY. Yes, as the name of the phone suggests, it has a massive battery and it lives up to the expectation. For the first time ever in smart phone life, I'm not worried about evening. And trust me, I have used may phones, be it Samsung, BB, Nokia, Microsoft. I have 2 sims, two gmail accounts on Sync and many other apps which need internet connectivity. I get many calls and my wifi is always on, even if I'm not in wifi zone. Still, the battery lasts and gives me a day and half of life line.  And if I'm I bit careful, on second day, the battery will last entire second day too. I don't use 3G.  - Processor + RAM- It has got 2GM ram and coupled with decent processor, Performs well. No visible/ prominent lag. Asking beyond this will be unfair from a 9K phone.  - Screen- Screen is decent. Pixels are not prominent. And beyond this, it will be too much to ask.  Negatives: - CAMERA. CAMERA CAMERA. Yes. The camera is the worst aspect of the phone. It is supposedly 13mp, but still the pics are not of good quality. You have to be extra careful while taking pic, to avoid any shake or distortion. I have Huawei Honor 6, a 20K phone. It's camera is good till you dont zoom. And the moment you z900oom it, there are lots of noise. So looking at the contrast of the price, if may be un fare to ask for a good camera. But still, I would have loved to have a decent performing camera.  -Interface: Yes. The interface looks sick, out dated and tasteless, even though the phone runs on Android 5.0. Luckily, I have Action Launcher app. So I used it to overhaul the interface. It can be matter of personal choice, but still.  - Speakers- Ouch.. Speakers are bad too. So bad that even notification tones/ tunes sound shredded. Speaker are loud but awful.  Besides, these I haven't found any other flaw, give that it is a Rs9000  phone.

M3 is a bulky phone, and is heavy thanks to the Big battery inside. The phone comes with a Free Flip Cover in the Box.  #Display: 5\" HD Display with Good Viewing Angles.  #Software: This is powered by a Mediatek Mt6582 Chipset and comes with 1GB of Ram. I would have loved seeing this powered by an Octacore Mt6592 instead. Like every other Gionee phone in the Market, this too runs their Custom UI - Amigo UI on top of Android Kitkat. This comes with a lot of software additions, and tweaks offering better experience. Hotknot, Double tap to wake up etc are supported. Unfortunately since the UI is quite heavy comparing to Stock Android, expect lags often.  #Storage: Out of 8GB, you get around 2.5 GB for Apps. You can choose SDCard as the Default Installtion Location. OTG is supported.  #Camera: 8MP/2MP. Overall quality of the Rear Camera is quite Good. Front Camera is a Fixed Focus One.  #Battery: The Main reason for buying this device should be this huge 5000mAh Battery on board (non-removable). It can go on and on. The downside is, the handset is bulky and quite heavy. As of this writing no other phones ships with such a big battery.  #Verdict: Buy this for Battery.Overall performance of the Custom UI on this is not that great.

Yes a few sacrifices have to be made to make it just about Rs 5150. But that doesn't mean poor quality. Or bad functioning. In fact this phone's specifications are pretty much better than what we're used to.  It is a 4 inch phone with an agreeably sharp resolution of 800\u00d7480. Sharp because it is on a 4 inch. Sadly the display enhancement technologies like ClearBlack are not available. Ambient Light and Proximity Sensors have been included meaning Auto Brightness will work here.  The phone has a storage capacity of 8GB which is expandable to 128GB with an external SD card.  The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 SoC, with dual 1.2 GHz Cortex A7 cores. This is good since Windows Phone OS is good with low end devices in terms of speed unlike on Android.  One will be able to access the whole Windows Store of Applications as this phone has 1GB RAM.  The main camera sadly is just 2MP while the front camera 0.3MP. This are the major drawbacks of this phone. A 5MP camera would be better Microsoft. The phone comes with a 1500mAh battery which is also too low for most users nowadays.  Opinion :  Is this a good phone? Yes.  Would I buy it if I wanted a low end Windows Phone? No. Why? Because there is the Lumia 535 which beats this phone in everything and I'll only have to add a few thousands.

Cons :  I would not be writing any points here considering the price range , but yes there are flaws which i noticed  1) no flash 2) camera picture quality is just Ok in daylight , but a big no no in the night , goes same with the front camera ( but you should still be able to make skype calls ) 3) not a con but yes keep those micro sims ready if you currently have a normal sized sim card 4) thinking hard to figure out more points , sadly not able to ...

No pixelation is visible unless you get uncomfortably close to the screen; 4 modes to adjust the saturation/temperature; You wouldn't really miss a FHD display due to the sAMOLED screen, though probably you would be able to tell the difference if you're used to 1080p or higher - Battery: I'm pleasantly surprised how efficiently optimised this phone is! Don't go by the 2300 mAh number - You must be pushing it hard to get a 'bad' back-up with this one! - Temperature: This is among the most 'Coolest' phones I've ever used! :P I mean, It just doesn't heat-up like almost everything else does; while setting up the phone (at night) the max temp I reached was less then 35*C  Not so Good Things:  - Bloatware - There's a bit of Bloatware - you can get rid of some of them and hide the rest; Isn't bothering the performance and the RAM consumption is mostly below a GB.

With the Galaxy Alpha, the metal body was introduced in Samsung phones but the back was still made of plastic. But A series features full unibody design which gives the phone a sturdy feel(sturdy yet not premium). The RAM is plenty for a phone but what seems to be a point of concern here is the processor, which is comparable to the processors of a few android wear(Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53). What that means is, that while the phone feels snappy in daily tasks, it's exhibits a lacklustre performance in resource hogging tasks like gaming. A great new feature is that the micro SD card slot doubles as a sim card slot to make the phone dual sim. but that features compromises expandable memory.So to sum it up -  Pros- 1. Sturdy build 2. 2gb RAM 3. Interchangeable micro SD(Up to 64GB)/dual sim card slot 4. Nice camera(13 MP rear and 5 MP front), with features like wide frame selfies and animated gif selfies 5. Super slim(6.7mm) 6. Corning Gorilla Glass 4 7. Battery lasts a day no issue, though it is a 2300(Li-Ion) mAh battery.

High price for the specifications  Bottomline This phone has almost the same specifications as Lenovo A6000 but is more costly. The sturdy build and slim form factor makes the phone feel good in hand, but still lacks a premium touch. The camera is good and the comparable brother is Galaxy S5, except for the fact that this phone is 1.2 GHz quad while S5 has 2.5 GHz quad core processor.

The major advantages of this phone are: 1.Stunning Design-I have the champagne gold colour n it looks beautiful...Every bit of it! 2.Awesome front and back camera. 3.Full HD display 4.Fantastic keyboard-its the best I have used so far 5.Very Responsive Touch 6.Good browsing experience 7.I don't play a lot of games but the ones that I play like Stick Cricket,Real cricket 14 and Real Racing play without lags. 8.Have faced no heating issues at all 9.Awesome music player 10.And the best feature - Battery lasts 2 days If you enable power saving mode.Also comes with ultra power saving mode which gives standby time of upto 10 days...good feature to use during travel The touch wiz UI used by Samsung has a lot of features to offer a wonderful customer experience.I am very happy with the product. The only cons I found is that when you place a call on loudspeaker the volume is low and the alarm doesn't have the Rooster alarm tone.People are comparing this to Note 4...but honestly how many people will use all the features offered in Note 4 like the heart rate sensor..This phone has all the features that we need for everyday use -The best part is the design.. UPDATE - there's some heating after playing games for awhile,To counter this,I downloaded Cooler Master app from Google play.The phone cools down in 3-4 minutes after you stop playing games....One word of advice to prospective buyers - though the phone looks stunning, it seems a bit fragile to me.You need to take good care as the metal frame may be damaged in case you drop it.

The non-removable battery that comes along with the Samsung Galaxy A7 does not allow you to change it if any sort of mishap occurs and the battery is ruined. If the battery is ruined your whole phone is. Its battery capacity is not very withstanding ad is prone to be used up very quickly if you run heavy apps on it.

All d Android-One users are still having \"baba ji ka thullu\".  Camera is not good due to lack of Auto-focus but video capturing is just amazing.

Software: Xolo has released an Android Lollipop update ( Jan 16th ) for this device which is great considering official AndroidOne devices supported by Google are yet to get this update.Advantage AndroidOne devices have over this is that they will get software updates for 2 years or so from Google while support for Xolo One ends with Android L update.

Fully satisfied from what was expected & is delivered in the handset. Checked all features (except wifi). Each feature details below: 2. Battery: Recharged fully for the first time for 3 hours. Battery lasted for 33 hours before reaching 15%. Used 2G for 20 hours. Calls attended for 2 hours. Games played for 1.5 hours. Used single sim during this time. Disabled all unnecessary features like background sync, vibration on touch, animated wallpapers (live). After 8 to 10 days of use (completed 2-3 charge discharge cycles), now my battery lasts for 60-65 hours before reaching 15%. 3. Phone network: Good as I found. But in areas where there is less coverage, my old smartphone worked better. Could have been a bit better but satisfactory as at major areas we get full coverage. 4. 3g / 2G: Have tested both. Works fine. 2nd Sim might be enabled only for 2g as I see only GSM emborsed on the sim holder while primary sim holder reads GSM / WCDMA. 5. Screen: Pretty decent size. Touch is also sensitive (capacitive), good. Not an extremely bright & colorful screen like the 15k + phones but good. 6. Storage: Installed 4-5 applications, overall space available is 1.27 GB for installing apps, I still have 850MB+ storage available for installing apps. 7. Voice quality is also good, not less. Audible in crowded areas too. 8. Rig tone sound is also decent, not very less. 9. Used the games provided in the phone eg. Fishing joy & Diamond wonderland, works decently. I am not game freak so just played for some time to test the phone if it encounters some issue like hanging, slowness etc. Worked fine. 10. Headphones are also ok quality. Sound quality is good, but not very comfortable to wear (large ones without cushion, not like Samsung which go inside the ears). 11. Tested Radio, works fine. 12. Tested WLAN (wifi), shows networks available in the vicinity. But did not try to connect as all were locked networks & required password. 13. Bluetooth: Works fine. Transferred files, work good. Also connected to car stereo system & was able to use as handsfree. Made & accepted calls through the car stereo, works fine. 14. Tethering: Connected to internet through my phone network using tethering. Work fine. Used WLAN tethering as well as USB tethering, easy to setup & works fine 15. Using as USB storage: Connected to my laptop for transferring files to phone SD card. Works fine. 16. Used Super Backup application to transfer contacts, calendar, SMS.

Pros:   1. Voice Recognition - voice recording and voice recognition is simply the best.   2. Camera - compared to 2MP, this camera is offers really good quality. for those who want to use camera just to take photos of the notices on the blackboard and of the pages of friends' notebook, this camera is more than enough!   3. Brand Name- the brand name matters as the accessories of Micromax and Karbonn devices are not easily available.   4. Extraordinarily fast processing- during usage, it had no lags whatsoever and it worked really very smooth. for eg. when we capture a photo, it gets processed within a millisecond and we are ready to take the next photo ! but for the same thing, my friend's Micromax bolt A47 ( which has 1.3 GHz dual core processor ) it takes at least 2 second to open the camera....   5. Battery Life- for low to medium usage, the battery drops by 20% daily.   6. Touch- the touch is just awesome.. Cons:   1. Viewing Angle- the display is almost IPS, but surprisingly, when viewed from vertically upward, we can't see ANYTHING ! that is really a headache for the gamers..   2. No System Upgrades- we have to use the same android version throughout which is pre-installed. even the flagship smartphones of Lenovo are waiting for upgrade ( courtesy- vishki.com )  Verdict:   those who want to use basic features of a smartphone, who are non- gamers and who want a long living meticulous device this is the best buy at any price range..."], ["4.0", "6 months of usage and still lovin it :)", "Fazal", "Hi All,  I purchased this phone on 2 October 2014 and within 48 hours it was delivered good going Amazon, and for the past 6 month I have been using it as rugged as a phone can bare it.  Well my initial review was about functionality and features of this phone but in this review I am going to list the pros and cons is terms of Specifications, which I had to faced and observed after 6 months of usage.  &#61692; DISPLAY: -------- &#8226; Pro - The display comes with approx 233 ppi pixel density which makes it crisp and bright. Compared to other mobiles with this pixel density, it is good to watch HD movies and videos on small screen.  &#8226; Con - The screen size is mentioned is 4inch but the ration of screen to body is ~57.4%. And the main con is when you tilt it to your right the screen is fades and on the other side it gets darkened, it orientation might vary depending on the positioning of the phone in your hands.  &#61692; BATTERY: -------- &#8226; Pro - As per the phones specifications listed on Lenovo's website it states that it comes with 1500mAH battery providing talk-time of 14 hours 30 minutes and standby time of 288 hours, whereas for the past 6 months the reality is that with talktime and 3G usage on occasionally watsapp, utube etc it will provide you a healthy support for atleast 18-20 hrs and with continuous it can with hold upto only 10-12 hours. &#8226; Cons - Well if you are watching a movie let&#8217;s say about 1:45min it will heat up pretty badly and if the brightness is full then the battery from 100% will drain in nearly half.  &#61692; MEMORY: ------- &#8226; Pro - Well with RAM of 512MB only 450MB is accessible, and with 4GB of RAM with latest phones this is not a PRO at all, but in this price of 3.5K its huge and with this brand the optimization and dividend among the apps is sufficient to run the Benchmarked Game &#34;Temple Run 2&#34; with an ease. And in terms of ROM ie internal memory it comes with an approx of 1.25GB and another of 1.3GB alongside with Andriod 4.2.2 (JellyBean) combining upto roughly 3GB. But you can use 32GB SD card and there is no lag in that, as I am doing it. &#8226; Con - Well you have give up online gaming with this one, as it doesn't supports a lot many of them and the one which it supports laggs a hell lot of.  &#61692; CAMERA: ------- &#8226; Pro - It does come with a 2MP camera and with more than ample amount of light the picture/video is perfect. &#8226; Con - It doesn't have a front facing camera, so goodbye Skype and other Video Calling Apps, and it also doesn't have flashlight and that is a bummer. If you are a Photo Mad then please DO NOT go for this. And it does comes with Panorama & smile detection, but the smile detection is not that great it like you have to smile like a Mad person then only it will detect it and as for Panorama, oh GOD, it's just there for namesake.  &#61692; USER INTERFACE: --------------- &#8226; Pro - It comes with a pre-installed Launcher from Lenovo and for the Andriod Beginners its great in terms of user friendly and with navigation. But as always you can opt for various other 3P Launchers available in Play Store with which you can play. Like, Next Launcher, GO &#8226; Launcher, and my favourite DOODLE Launcher. &#8226; Con - Firstly after few days of using the preinstalled Launcher I was bored and then I installed many other 3P launchers but that actually made this phone very slow and non-responsive to many high end Launchers. A 3P Launcher actually consumes the RAM a lot. And the launch buttons at the bottom of the screen are not coloured and that is a real bummer to use it in Night.  &#61692; GAMING: ------- &#8226; Pro - Games under than 100MB, like Temple Run 2, Candy Crush, Subway Surfers, Flow Free Bridges, Hungry Shark Evolution etc, will run smoothly without any lag or any glitches. &#8226; Cons - As mentioned above along with the RAM compatibility there is not much to experiment with online game or with games more than 100 MB of storage.  &#61692; CONCLUSION: ----------- This is one of a kind device for normal usage with Andriod OS on top of a Brand like Lenovo, but the cons outweigh this phone in every aspect like memory, camera, gaming, display etc but with 3.5K as a price with these features combined what more can you expect. And so far there were some issue with heating &#34;occasionally&#34; but not like everyday but like based on continuous usage, and to monitor I installed DU Battery Saver to keep track of my battery Performance.  The main hassle was finding a decent cover for this phone there are like none to zero chances of availability of Covers in the market and online you will only find from Zero to Few, and I have like 5 covers but none of them actually fits perfectly but you have to make the best of it.  I have uploaded some pictures of its Specification according to CPU-Z app, and some of the picture from its camera.  &#61692; AND THANKS FOR GIVING YOUR VALUABLE TIME FOR READING SUCH A LONG REVIEW."], ["1.0", "Avoid this one", "Anand Rajan", "I purchased this device last week and my mic n speakers stopped working.

Can't comment on performance of Lumia, but from my known acquaintances, Windows phone does not have such problems.  UI is fresh and easy to navigate. Not a palm top computer like any Samsung Note.  No theme concept in Lumia other than coloring. Trendy.  Touch is responsive, at least 10% better than Android.  Widgets are just icons to the actual control page &#60; this actually not a good idea :) MISSING my HTC Desire optical track ball! ... was really an added advantage while typing.  Speaker ear piece hole just on the edge, bit uncomfortable for long duration calls. Voice clarity is natural and brilliant! Volume is little lower side.

Screen display: IMO, what else we could expect from such a small device. It is HD display, 245ppi! Not able to identify any pixels.  Camera: If somebody wants to replace their Handy Cam or DSLR, this is not for them. But enough for occasional scene capture.  Design: slim.

Secondly, Q3000, In this model the charger stopped working in its 3rd month itself. When I have approached the service center they are worst bunch of service center people I have experienced in my life. They in no sense know the meaning of the term &#34;Service&#34;. They have made me feel that customer is a slave if you have brought this company's products. I gave my q3000 model charger to the service center people they have given me a q1010i charger after 10days of my continues followup.When I denied to accept it they said to trust them and they will give me my model charger in more 10-15days. Now, they are saying that submit the q1010i charger also and they will give me a charger of q3000 after more 15days as they cannot get my original charger from the company and if I leave this charger also with them then only they will give me that charger after 15 days. They will talk to the customer in the most abusive manner a person can and have asked me to whatever I can.  In Q700i I have given the phone to them for the repairing of the problem but they have taken the phone and will be giving after repairing after 2months only.

Note 3 Neo has 8 MP camera but it produces excellent pictures and they are far far better and good looking than other branded cameras and we can say that its the 2nd best ever made 8MP camera anyhow 1st is apple's camera[in 8 MP series]. &#34;Its not about the camera pixels but about that software that process the camera matters & samsung has great camera software&#34; 2. This phone gave me 32000 Antutu Benchmark rating. I think its one of the best scores. 3. Spen is a great feature, most of the people say there is no use of Spen its time taking process to use Spen, but in my opinion Spen is great feature and i always want somthing special in my phone which is this Spen. It brings back the feel of writing ur Messages than typing them.... excellent feature by SAMSUNG. 4. Display: I heard in many reviews that SGN3Neo does not have Gorilla Glass protection, but its wrong.. this mobile comes with Gorilla Glass 2, dont worry if u want extra  protection buy a tampered glass screen protector, and its very easy to install. I installed my first screen protector in my life ant that's without any air gap or dust particles.   The screen is around 270 Pixel Per INCH and remember it is a 5.5 INCH phone so u will get totally a large number of pixels to see. 5. Battery life: 3100 mAh battery will go 1.5 - 2 days for 1 full charge. And remember unlike LGG2,SG S4, & HTC One (E8 or M8) this has less PPI value be4 mentioned have more than 400PPI. Less PPI means less battery consumption. So it can run days for 1 charge. 6. Samsung gives good warranty service and charges also pretty less.  And its time about Cons: 1. I bought the black version but the charger and earphones still are white. I saw many unboxing videos but in all i observed the same, its little little odd to have white charger for a black mobile. No issues with white version, same white charger and earphones are provided. 2. The display is good and one handed operation is possible but we cannot reach the side capacitive buttons with one hand, anyhow samsung provided a solution giving one handed operation application which allows you to reduce ur display to smaller area. that's it about cons ......  Close competitors and their disadvantages according to SGN3Neo 1] Best competitor is SG S4   Pros with cons: great PPI 441 and hence more battery consuming,   Slim and handy But SGN3 Neo is slim but not handy but we have got Spen to  beat SG S4.   True advantage is 13 MP back camera, excellent pics as its from samsung.  2] LG G2:   Again More PPI not need fr human eye and its battery eater too.   13 MP camera, but I dont think think this takes better pics than SGN3Neo due to average camera software. non removable battery fr LG G2, and no memory slot too... True Advantage is: OIS feature in camera will take little less effort in take picture. knock On feature is pretty useful but again it consumes more battery.  3] HTC One E8:   More PPI more battery consumption, and again non removable battery and no external memory card slot.  One main draw back is: HTC Unibody design, its very difficult to replace screen when it cracks, its costs around 15K and u have to say good bye to ur phone for 1 month as it needs be fixed accurately and perfectly and so it will be sent to tiwan or US etc.  Advantage: Good camera, build quality and Mainly Boom surround and Beats audio are excellent, very handy, good looks.  If u are sure that u can handle ur phone very carefully without damaging the screen u can go for it and its 10K more too.  I an not even considering micromax, xolo, karbon and all local brands as they are not upto these mobiles.  All the above mentioned close competitors will cost more than SGN3 Neo.  Finally, Its upto the user requirements to choose a mobile, SGN3Neo satisfied my requirements, and hope this will satisfy urs too.

You can see a video at [...]  I purchased this phone in stunning Black from another marketplace & got it delivered on February 15. From design & hardware perspective, this phone is a class leader at it's price in most aspects. But Xolo has ruined the Android experience.  Design & Hardware Pros : Overall the phone feels to be of a much higher price range * Zero Panel Gaps. Brilliant non joint smooth metal casing between front & rear panels. * Stunning chrome finish embossing of the logo on the rear. Premium colour finishing of the front & rear panels. * Only phone at this budget with Dual SIM 3G support which is not even found in Sony Xperia C or Moto G. Feature not mentioned in actual specifications, found in the Network settings on the phone. * Clever integration of Earpiece(top) & mic(bottom) with dual front speakers, closing hard to clean large dust accumulation locations. * Better Camera & Bright LED : LED compared with A500s illuminates well at about 3m as a functional emergency torch in case of a night power outage. Compared with A500S a shot in pitch dark *INTERIORS* does a fair capture.  Design & Hardware Cons : Some slight niggles * Confusing fragile Sim 1 Mini, Sim 2 Micro & Micro SD slots integrated together, without a push to release option making it hard to release sim cards. * No Magnetometer which is needed for navigation. (Generally not found in this price range. Xolo missed an ace) * No back lighting of hard touch buttons.  Xolo has fudged up with the stock Android build of A500S (version 4.2.2) in a very disgusting manner for this phone, copying Samsung (and indirectly Apple) interface. The settings screen is all messed up, & if you are used to stock android & never used crap Samsung interface, then you will feel miserable. It could easily run stock Android 4.3.1, giving Xolo another ace at this price point but instead they have goofed up by doing useless customizations.  Software Cons : (No software Pros, it is so bad) * Removed option to disable incoming calls from contacts you want to block. Forced to install an app for this. * Cant use Google Now voice calling as there is no way to choose a default sim out of the two sims & thus each time you use Google Now to call/text, eventually you will have to use touch again to choose the sim to use. * Cant remove multiple calls or messages threads simultaneously. You have to delete each separately or delete all. No option to do multi select like stock Android. * Cant see multiple numbers of a contact when using T9 smart typing to find name. Only first number is callable.You have to go to contacts listing to choose other numbers. As mentioned in the next point even that is screwed. * If you use custom contacts display option from Android, the Xolo customizations are a bummer. I like to keep only a few contacts displayable for WhatsApp on my phone, as I don't want to cram my WhatsApp list with the large amount of numbers I have. You can still choose custom contacts listing from different accounts, but what happens is that, now when you want to call one of the non displayed Google contacts with multiple phone numbers as mentioned above, they are not searchable by typing any more. So you have to enable them for listing, just for that brief period of time you want to call them infrequently. * Removed roaming indicator from notification bar, thus leading to confusion with sim identification. I use 2 Vodafone connections from 2 different states. Xolo has removed the option to rename or color code the sims present in stock Android, instead adding a tiny icon to identify the sim for the incoming call. The sim cards just register with the name of the service provider by default & that can't be changed. * Data usage monitor has been completely removed. Navigation bar data usage indicator is no longer linked to the active data sim. This leads to major confusion when you want to use the nifty 3G switching feature as, you have to double check the data sim being used with no direct indicator. * The Xolo Power App just reads the defaults, the Android interface in Settings already provides, which have been disabled from there, & repackaged as bloatware. Xolo has removed the option to see simple things like Battery % on navigation bar itself & instead the app has to be fired up to see the exact battery level each time.  Xolo has ruined the basic phone features of Dual Sim Call/SMS completely. These can possibly be recuperated by installing additional apps, but then why would you want to drain your battery with those. Overall, because of the immensely superior design & hardware at such a low price range, I would still give the Phone a 3/5 for a pathetic software bloat."], ["4.0", "Great touch. 2", "kamal nayan bhatt", "This phone is available in market at a price Rs.6500.

They dont know about it. They know only one finishing.. which is White. yes it is funny. The phone amazon is selling has no Matte finish back panel. They dont have matte finish models and they dont talk about it in details which is confusing and misleading. If you are ok with glossy, do not hesitate to buy this phone.  1.The is monster battery phone. 5.7 in your hand looks huge and the finish is way better than any micromax or any other Chinese brand phone. 2. The screen resolution is not full HD but still it is clear and clean. The default color scheme looks beautiful. You can change the color tone in the settings with your own choice. So this is brilliant step by microsoft. 3. The camera: I think this is pone of the best camera phone in this price range.the back camera is 13 MP but it surely looks way better than any other 13 MP camera phones. The pictures are way better than any other 13 MP android phones. you actually can use shutter speed. If you have steady hands, you will get brilliant pictures in darkness. If you want the phone for best camera, go ahead for this beast. The camera app Lumia camera is beautiful with advances settings and basic settings for normal user. 4. the finishing: Phone looks premium and rich. the back panel is beautiful. white color looks premium. I am android lover but tgis phone surely changed my viewes about windows phones. 5. This phone's battery is beast. If you arre moderate phopne user, and yoy dont play games, the battery will last as long as 3 days. Yes 3 days. if you watch videos, surf net on WIFI, it goes 2 days for sure. This battery is real beast. NBo android phone will last long as much as tis phone. 6. Brand: People are running crazy for Chinese brands, this brand is trustworthy for indiand more than 2 decades, It is microsoft, so if they launch something, they will take care of the trust. 7. Cash back: The inbuilt app mobiqwik gives you 200 rs cashback every month for next 5 months, this is simply brilliant. please googlr for this offer or go through microsoft site 8. soon it will have windows 10 and it will be more faster and speedy. 9. Small but crystal clear speakers.  1. this is huge phone, so it is sometimes not easy to handle. you will get finger ache if you hold this phone for longer than 10 mins. 2. less apps compared to android and iOS. But soon all andorid apps will be compatible with windows, so wait for the good news.  If you want a good rich premium phone with great battery and best camera, if you dont care for availability of all andorid apps (at least for newxt few months) stop wasting your time and go for this. and I am NOT windows lover. still I found this phone beautiful."], ["5.0", "Best from Microsoft till now!", "Chaitanya Barwad", "It was a tough decision first of all to decide whether to buy a Windows Phone or Stick to an Android.

I liked smaller one earlier and had almost decided for buying it, but due to exams, The purchase was postponed.. Now with 1 month before getting released, and exams over, i decided to research a little regarding the bigger one.. At first, with only raw specs available, I disliked it, but soon when it started to get limelight, My opinion reversed... Now with Lumia 640 XL in my hands, Here is the actual review and opinion!  640 XL is Big compared to other phones, but I dont think It should be categorised as a Phablet. It fits in My hand, It doesn't at all feel bulky and looks Classic. It may look over-weighed in specs column, but take it in hand, and you will feel a big difference! It isn't at all heavy. Actually it feels light, and Perfect to hold. Build Quality is Satisfactory, and Corning Gorilla Glass is Indestructible, (not actually!).

Initially I was skeptical to buy Micromax but nevertheless I felt this is a good phone and so I again ordered for another A177 (will receive it today).

Amazon delivered this within a single day all the way from Mum to Blr with 2 day dlvry option and left my wife pleasantly shocked at the speed!  Pros:  1. Best part is the huge capacity battery, that lasts 3 days for moderate usage and more than a day for heavy usage. This would be good for my wife as her work involves lots of phone calls and she frequently complains out of charge 2. The screen looks really big on this as the surrounding bezel is relatively thinner 3. Jelly bean OS and this 1.3 Ghz duo processor really appear to like hand in glove in this model 4. Sound quality is quite good and phone reception looks decent on Airtel / Bangalore. Both GSM and CDMA networks supported 5. Has all the jingles like Bluetooth, Wifi and FM radio 6.

All features like Bluetooth, WiFi, charging were working properly. But suddenly while checking I noticed that there was no network in my phone. I went out of home and network appeared. I get full signal in my other phones so I was bit worried about this. I inserted another sim and same situation. No network. I tried different variation like inserted sim from first slot to another, add two different sim's in two slots etc. But no change in signal. After doing some r&d I found that phone was not picking signal in any building only in open air I was getting full signal. Even that was also dropping abruptly. So I decided to return as it was not serving my purpose of calling from home.  Besides this phone is really nice. If you hold it in your hand you feel like you are holding 15,000 rs. phone.

Period.", "aguy", "NOTE: Samsung gets 0 stars, the phone gets 5 stars, even 6.  The Note 3 is awesome, but customers should be upset over the SIMM lock on it, and NOT get this N9000 model. The N9005 or a carrier model is the only way to go.  This international version is not for US users or even US users who travel. If you are not a traveler forget the comments about it being region locked.  I still say 99.9% of all people who get the Note 3 could not care less if the international version is region locked. However, this model, if you expect to use it in other countries has resulted in a thousand problems, literally. The phone is neutral but when it is activated the SIMM locks in the region and you cannot use it elsewhere. Do not think &#34;unlocked&#34; means you have magical usage. There is NO universal phone (except for spies), although some phones use other country SIMM cards -- but not this one! I get a US carrier phone, travel internationally, and keep my phone in airplane mode and use WIFI or get a phone card.  Get the scoop. Do a search for XDA-Developers dot com, and go to the site. This is where the big boys and girls hang, for programming, not dumb questions. Type in Galaxy Note 3 in the field for the phone you desire. In the Forums, go to galaxy note 3 general. Search down the page to the thread &#34;SIMM restrictions on unlocked European Note 3.&#34; This thread has over 1300 posts. Yes this is a big problem. Read the first half dozen pages and the last 10 pages, but also check especially posts 1041 through 1045, and pages 117 and 18.  This N9000 phone is the international or European version. It was released 2-3 weeks prior to the US versions, it is NOT LTE it is 3G; it has a different CPU -the Samsung Exynos 5 processor, not the Qualcom Snapdragon 800. US residents should not get it. We need to get a phone activated for our respective carriers, which changes the last digit of the number. Search Amazon for the Note 3 for your carrier. Notice the different last digit.  Amazon may be confusing people by not listing the phone for what it really is and they need to change that in the title of the phone. The black version does say 'International&#34; in the title and so should the white one.  Now, down to business.  First, I am not affiliated with Samsung in any way, nor do I work for a cell phone store. I am a writer though. Secondly, I hate long reviews where the poster just reports the specs you already have. Rather, these comments show why the Galaxy Note 3 is more technologically advanced, and more phone for your money, compared to the many good phones on the market today, and the not so good phones, like the cave phone (that's what I call it) that does nothing.  1. The beautiful 5.7&#34; Super Amoled HD display has a &#34;Wow!&#34; factor. Everything is crisp and clear with a resolution of 1920 x 1080P, 386 PPI. Despite a few good contenders, no phone on the market can match the combination of vibrant color, and deep blacks. Check it out for yourself. For those who prefer drab, you can even adjust color intensity and contrast. Is this practical? You bet. You get more viewable data for all social networking apps; you can see more email and contacts without scrolling; browsing is quick and pages more visible; YouTubes and video are fantastic; games are more playable; you can see larger areas on GPS maps; you get a better view of radar in weather; (live) wallpapers look great; you can use it as a reader; you can multitask with it; and with the right productivity apps you can even get some work done on it. I will never go back to a small screen phone.  2. The CPU in the US versions is the quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 @ 2.3, which is the fastest processor on the planet as of this time. It will perform well for years to come. A few other phones have it. The international version uses the Samsung Exynos 5 processor. It also has another quad core processors making it octa core, but it is still not quite as fast as the Snapdragon.  3. The Adreno 330 GPU is the best on the market, a few other phones have it. It is 50% faster than the Adreno 320 in the Galaxy S4 which is a screamer.  4. It's the only phone to come with 3 GB of DDR 3 RAM. It also comes standard with 32 gigs of storage and you can add more with an SD card. Note: No extra charges for these!  5. It has a great 13 megapixel camera with useful software, a BSI Sensor, Smart Digital Stabilization and high CRI LED. Very few phones have this. It is also the only phone to do 4K video right now - sharp!  6. No other phone has USB 3.0. 2 advantages: the phone charges very quickly on the 2 amp charger and nice thick cable. File transfer times are faster. With USB 3.0, a 2 gig file takes 27 seconds from the Note 3 to my (high end) PC. With USB 2.0 the same file takes 57 seconds.  7. How many phones have an S Pen? Except for email and quick notes, I seldom used the S Pen on my original Galaxy Note, but the Note 3 comes with some useful software making it more functional, and the handwriting recognition is scary accurate.  8. How many phones have a huge 3200 mA battery? It easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use despite the large screen. Hardware and software improvements make the 100 mA bump over the Note 2 even more significant. You can also open the back and change out the battery - unlike some phones.  9. It does infrared remote control. It also has TV-out (via MHL A/V link), Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, temperature, humidity, and gesture sensor. I'm serious people, you get more for your money.  10. Hello multitasking! The fast CPU & GPU, extra memory, and high-resolution 5.7 inch screen make multitasking feasible and fun on a cell phone. You can even scroll through multiple applications in each split screen. This is even better if you hook up a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth or USB, and connect through HDMI to your TV or computer monitor. The Note 3 can actually serve as a small computer. How many phones can do that? You can also mirror the phone screen with your smart TV for internet, games, viewing pics, whatever.  11. This the best cell phone for gaming on the market , period. The above features and OpenGL 3.0 which is part of Android 4.3 make it happen. Don't believe me? Read the reviews, watch the you tubes, and compared it for yourself.  12. It doesn't just have GPS, it also uses A GPS (improved), and Glonass Satellites. DL a GPS satellite app, and you'll see it will access between 5 and 25 satellites at once depending on time of day and location.  13. Got Knox? No, you don't. This phone provides business enterprise, and government level security for boot, VPN, etc., and comes in handy for privacy on public Wi-Fi. You don't have to use it, but it is there.  14. The air command and air gesture features make the phone futuristic. How many phones do that?  15. Is the screen too large for one handed operation? Yes, but so what? The tradeoff is worth it. Besides, Samsung now includes software to shrink it for one-handed so you get the best of both worlds.  There are 2 things that Samsung needs to improve in my opinion. I don't know how many thousands of people need to tell them that putting the volume rockers directly opposite the power button is inconvenient for users. The Note 2 placement was better but still wrong. (I do like the new speaker placement though. Its perfect for horizontal viewing because your hand channels the sound to the user). This phone should also be waterproof right out-of-the-box. Not a scaled-down version, just waterproof the thing. Other manufacturers are doing it for their flagship phones. That means Samsung can do it too. Truth be known, we users never want to see another flagship phone that is not waterproof. It's doable, so please do it. Smoke it with that nano-whatever waterproofing stuff. You went to CES. (Oh, and S voice is still sorry, use Google voice)  All that said, I'm very, very, happy with the Note 3. IMHO the Note 3 is so powerful and functional, it is the first device I would classify as a hand held computer. As a professor, I researched it for days and used the original Galaxy Note for over a year now. There are other good phones, but the Note 3 does it in one package, and in almost all cases does it better, for the same flag-ship- phone price. I feel sorry for the fanboys and people believing advertising hype who don't research the market. They pay top dollar but don't get their money's worth. Amazon is a great place to get your money's worth and to find out user information. Thanks Amazon.  Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention, it's a really good phone too."], ["5.0", "Great display but overpriced", "Tausif Kazi", "Great display but overpriced!

There is no other Android device having such a usable stylus software features. 5) Android 4.4 Kitkat Upgradable - Update is available in India. 6) Great Camera - One of the best you can get in an Android phone. 7) Plethora of sensors - Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, temperature, humidity, gesture 8) A lot of software additions helping to do things with various gestures. 9) Huge 3,200mAh battery. 10) 32GB internal memory + microSD card (upto 64GB) slot. 11) Multi-window features - This is built for great multitasking as you can open multiple apps in split screen for multitasking.

Sony being a worldwide brand for electronics and home appliances, every customer expects to get prompt and appropriate service for their products, but in my case I failed to receive satisfactory service for a premium product like Xperia Z1&#8230;..  1. On 24th December when I woke up in the morning I saw my Xperia Z1 display having a crack from inside the cabinet.. There was no damage on the external glass but however, the display had cracked from inside.. A single scratch cannot be seen from the external where the display has cracked&#8230;.  2. In my case the local service center people are asking me to pay 18,000+ rupees to replace my handset completely instead of replacing the display although my handset is under warranty and the display had also cracked on it's own from inside. There is no sign of external damage on the screen.  3. Sony Customer Care executives and Sony Service Center are not well trained and they do not understand customer grievances. They are least bothered about the customer satisfaction and only think of ways to extract more money from the customer. Nobody bothered to give me a callback to update me about the status. I had to keep following up with the customer care helpline as well as the Sony Service Center. I know few acquaintances who had similar experience with Service Center, Bhubaneswar.  4. My handset contained some photographs in the internal storage with my father who died this year and that was more valuable to me. I requested the service center to take the backup of my phone but they refused that it cannot be done as display is cracked .If I can do the data backup after exploring the internet for few hours then why can't the technicians employed by Sony do the same ??? Aren't they qualified enough???  5. While I handed over the handset to the service center there was a small area of damage to the display but when I received the handset from them the area of damage had increased significantly.. I have the photographs available with me..  6. I had heard that Sony Xperia Z1 is a flagship model and during service period the service center provides a temporary handset but in my case no temporary handset was also issued to me.  7. After sending an email to Sony Senior Management in India Sony Head Office Support team sent an email stating I have to pay 50% of MRP for refurbished handset without accessories and 80% of MRP (Rs 28,500/-) for fresh handset without accessories&#8230;.. Prices offered by local Sony Service Center and head office vary significantly which proves there is no baseline price&#8230; Whatever happens to your handset Sony people will simply ask you to pay another 20k -30k instead of replacing the faulty equipment&#8230;  It&#8217;s really frustrating as Sony Customer Service people are asking me to pay another 28k for the handset which is under warranty and the screen has also cracked on its own due to faulty design/bad quality equipment being used.  Trust me guys the service being offered by Samsung for Galaxy S4 which is a comparable model with Z1 is much better than Sony&#8230; Sony is having the worst after sales service&#8230; I would like to request everyone not to go by brand instead buy the products having better after sales service to make your life hassle free&#8230;&#8230;"], ["5.0", "The best phone out there.

Many people are complaining about battery, but I found the battery to be working quite well. The offline maps and offline driving assistant apps i.e. here maps and here drive are awesome. Just had to do a 1GB download for the entire map of India for offline use. The only problem with Windows phone is that Google services doesn't work. Only G-Mail, Google Calender and Google Contact works. Using a 3rd party app for Google Drive. No hangouts and no Google Chrome. Most importantly, there is no youtube app available. You have to use IE browser to watch youtube videos.  Regarding gaming, 1GB of Ram and 1.2GHz Snapdragon 200 dual core processor does a acceptable quality work! Based on my observation, a lag exist in games when they are started and then things become lag free. Asphalt, Guardian of the skies, spider man works great on the phone only if you can ignore the initial lag that happens in all the games!  Camera is more that good for a 2MP pinhole!

The Lumia 435 is a great performer for its price tag.  It is common knowledge that Windows Phone OS is pretty darn light and snappy. It doesnt need  octa-core processors to run smoothly. Indeed, even on this humble little device running on a 1.2 Ghz dual core processor and 1 GB of ram, the performance is absolutely stutter free.  I bought this phone for my mother and it took her about a day to get used to the simple tiles layout, coming from a Nokia feature phone with keypad. It just shows how easy the Windows Phone UI is, even for first timers.  Anyways, here is my pros and cons list for Lumia 435:  Pros : 1) Sturdy build that you'd come to expect from Nokia (now Microsoft). Feels chunky in the hand, but in a reassuring way. Materials used dont feel cheap at all. 2) Absolutely stutter free performance with the 1.2 Dual Core Snapdragon 200 and 1 GB of ram. Just remember its limitations. This is not a gaming device. 3) Touch response is great. No issues like the Lumia 535. 4) The screen is fairly good for its price. Colors pop well when you look at it straight from the front. 4&#34; screen should be adequate for its target users as well as for those who prefer compactness over phablets. 5) Network performance and call quality is typical Nokia quality. 6) Works great with a 128GB MicroSD. More than enough for a pocket jukebox.  Cons : 1) The Camera is a disappointment. 2mp cams with no auto focus have no place even in this price range these days. The front cam is strictly for skype calls at 0.3 mp. Dont try selfies with it. 2) The battery could've been slightly larger given this is a dual sim phone. With light usage, it makes it through the day. Any enthusiastic usage will drain the battery before the day is over. So keep that Power bank handy. 3) The screen fades from any angle other than straight up front. Plus, it reflects a lot of light, making it harder to read in direct sunlight.  All things considered, this is a great phone for beginners as well as elderly people who are just getting used to the concept of smartphones. For everyone else, you have better spec-ed Lumias to choose from. :)"], ["4.0", "Perfect 5k phone", "Shanthi", "Needed a smartphone with Whatsapp, Viber, Skype and Facebook. Budget was around 7k.

I installed a third party app i.e. Ucam and believe me photos are awesome in good light regarding night capture noise was always a problem with Sony camera but in manual mode if you adjust the settings accordingly to the conditions believe me noise will be reduced to great extent. I&#8217;m sure people facing issues with stock camera is due to some software issues which I can say that Sony will resolve in future updates. 2.Battery:  Well this is one of the major reasons I fell in love with this mobile. 6&#8221; screen and with the most beautiful display I was not expecting anything but 2-2.5 hrs of screen on time. But to my surprise I got 5hrs 38 mins of screen on time with brightness at 75%-80% still 10% battery is remaining and the total discharge time from 100% to 10% is 1d 0h 3m which is miles better than any 6&#8221; phones today previously I needed to charge the phone every evening. Finally I feel I&#8217;m using mobile previously always connected to charger felt like landline (:- P). Also I did not use any stamina mode my Google sync was on for entire testing along with Wi-Fi and GPS too.  3.Performance:  Did not install any games but did not feel like using 1GB RAM the experience was flawless no lag at all. People complaining about the RAM are the ones who are heavy gamers and do lots and lots of tasks for them it will surely be an issue. But for moderate users like me using WHATSAPP, GPS and Google, this device is more worth to what it has been priced. So overall performance is very very good all credits to Sony for their good software optimizations.  4.Display:  The first thing you will notice about this phone is its awesome display. IPS display has done the magic. Viewing angles are also very good. Images are crisp and clear even though the pixel density is less but it stands out when compared to other phones displays. And Bravia Engine 2 adds further charm to the display. Overall a killer display.  5.Body:  Very sturdy and well-built with good positioning of headphone jack and charger port. It feels royal and the glossy finish at the back adds more glamors to the phone. About the weight if I do not mention it then it would be unjust for the phone, it is so light weight you will never feel you are keeping a phablet in your pocket.  6.Sound:  Yes I agree the sound is low compared to the speaker size given at the back. But who listens to songs on speakers or watch movies using speakers for me I have never done that I always used headphones to listen anything be it songs or movies. The loudness is low which I think can be overcome with some software changes after getting root access to mobile which I hope to see soon on XDA Developers. I had Xperia S prior to this and I used Xperia S headphones with this mobile and trust me the beats and sound is much much better. Overall not a major drawback it can be overcome by time.  7.Call quality:  I did not use two SIMS tested only with single SIM with 3G activated all the time and no call drops ever and clarity was good even in places where signal was very weak. Also used the speaker during a call it is good if you are not in crowded area as the speaker is not very loud but it is good and can be lived with.  8.Connectivity:  No issues at all in this department let me tell you that both SIMS cannot have 3G SIM1 supports 3G while SIM2 does not. No data connection lost for the entire testing period. Wi-Fi is also very good and captures signals even if signal is weak. Did not get time to test file transfer using Wi-Fi direct but I&#8217;m sure it will work fine.  9.GAMING - i m a game lover ....i have played few high end games(modern combat4,fifa14,dead trigger 2,real racing3,need for speed most wanted,iron man 3,riptide gp2,deus ex the fall,asphalt8,vrtual tennis,AVP) on this device and it runs very well witout any lag or jitter...awesome gaming xperience...ps4 connectivity.  10.MULTIMEDIA - sony in built support fr multimedia is jst amazing.....WALKMAN does provide a very pleasing music experience, hd movies run effortlessly ,movie watching is just superb....sound quality in earphone is exceptional....  That is my experience for this phone and I&#8217;m very very happy with this device."], ["5.0", "I like it....", "SUBEESH REGHU", "Super phablet. Day light camera pics are very good.

For first two months, phone restarts itself for more than three times a day. But sony has updated its software.  Now updated to kitkat 4.4.3. Now for five months it did not restart for a single time.nice updation. The display has natural colours. But the colours are not that brilliant and colourful as same hd Samsung, HTC, moto or lenovo phones. If u transfer a 'picture taken by ur SXT2 ultra camera' to a Samsung or HTC hd smartphone, it will look brilliant and more colourful on the other phone. The same games also will look more colorful on Samsung or HTC or lenovo phones. But I prefer natural colours on my SXT2 ultra. Camera features are very handy. The build quality is very nice and beautiful. But be careful.the back is very shiny black and can get scratch easily.. So I am using a transparent back cover. I am not using a flip cover because I don't want to hide its beauty. Dont expect too much loudness from this phone speaker. But use a good headset and do some adjustments in Walkman sound settings, sound quality will be great. 3000mah can stand one full day with more than average usage.

LG G4 is not just about specs but also the quality it holds. As you can see the bezels are small,which is really good for gaming and viewing FULL-HD Videos. The phone has a beautiful curve which make it excellent to hold. The display is surely one of the best to date and has to be seen to be believed. LED notification has over 8 colors,different for different notification. LG G4 has a removable battery which is rare in flagship devices.The battery backup is stellar for such a powerful device better do a research online about battery before buying. snapdragon 808  is surely a cooler version of 810(heating issues solved to some extent)  The benchmarks may not be better than some other flagship but the real life experience is somewhat different and better. at the end you don't need to worry about performance when going for this beast. The camera with a 16MP and 1.8 aperture size seems to perform better in every condition.  The daylight with HDR can handle the extra contrast really well resulting is excellent and sharper images.Even though samsung says s6 is best in low light by comparing it with iphone 6.they just didn't compare it with LG G4 which has the best 1.8 aperture size for stunning and sharp low light than most of the competition.The shutter lag is a little bit annoying.Its not the slowest but slow compared to other flagship.Selfie is surprisingly sharp. That's not the end either. The LG G4 has a laser focusing module on the back, which helps for focusing at low light and every difficult condition faster. The buttons at the back will take little time to adapt to.  The sunlight viewability is great. The specs are definitely future proof. It also has optional wireless charging feature, which is Qi-enabled  Above all the price is low than other flagships.  Update: LG Has released an update to fix some minor issues with heating and all. Update pics:"], ["5.0", "Boom boom g4", "Dr. singh", "This is a phone with some very good features.I expect even more innovative technology from LG.  PROCESSOR and DISPLAY It&#8217;s a fast phone thanks to its Fast 64-bit Snapdragon 808 processor. Opening of even larger apps is fast and smooth. Resolution of 2560x1440 is incredible for a sharp 5.5&#8221; Quad HD IPS Display.The sharp images with natural looking colors looks awesome. But similar screen is already available in number of smartphones and I think this feature has reached saturation as far as screen is concerned.  CAMERA The rear camera is 16MP with Optical Image Stabilization with sharp image quality. It uses laser focus feature of lg g3 for better focusing. High-res 8MP front camera can take good and sharp selfies. It can take video at 4K resolution with very realistic colors.  STORAGE It has got expandable storage feature. Cloud storage is not a very useful feature in Indian context where internet speed and accessibility is still limited compared to western countries. So I love this feature in a smartphone. The LG G4 comes with 32GB of built in memory and it can be expanded up to whooping 2TB (terabytes). The only problem is that 2TB microsd card is not available in the market!!   BATTERY The battery is removable with capacity of 3000mAh which I think fall short of my expectations from a LG's flagship device. I expected wireless charging feature which is missing from this device. You can remove battery to restart phone in rare event of freezing of phone(which is unlikely with this mobile). You can also carry an extra battery rather than a power bank for backups! I personally like this feature.  SOME OTHER FEATURES  Android lollipop version Slightly curved design with leather finish Loud Speaker Interchangeable back covers Screen tap to wake/sleep, Built-in in Battery monitor Camera support voice commands etc..  Only thing I didn't like in this phone is location of speaker(located at the back).  In short It's a high level smartphone with fast processor, awesome screen and amazing camera.

The class and elegance it showed in that pic, made me buy this phone. It&#8217;s not that I didn&#8217;t research about the phone at all, but Big B was one more factor for me to burn close to 50K on this phone. After using this phone for a week, I&#8217;m not sure if I have made the right decision. You will know why am saying this. Am not going to talk about all the good things about this phone, for that, LG has already created a damn good site. Go there and check out the specs, features, and amazing photos. Am going to talk about my real experience with this phone, so here it is: - Fluctuating Price: I have never seen the price of a product fluctuating even before it is officially launched. LG broke my perception about stable pricing. Even before G4 was officially launched, you could buy it from 45,000 to 50,000. It&#8217;s your bargaining skills that would fetch you a deal you want. This price variation is very scary. Imagine you buy this phone for 49,999 and your friend comes and tell you that s/he bought it for just 40K. Believe me you will feel bad! LG should have controlled the pricing of its phone at least before the official launch. Shouldn&#8217;t they? - Heat: it&#8217;s already very hot in most parts of India, buying this phone would only increase your body temperature. I used it for 30 minutes for Google maps and then I got a call, I couldn&#8217;t keep this phone on my ear. It was that HOT! Agreed, that you have got one of the better processor on board, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that I won&#8217;t be able to use the most basic feature of this phone. After installing Temperature Guard app, I noticed that the battery temperature reached 46 degree Celsius. I&#8217;d to switch my off! On the other side, I believe it is LG&#8217;s marketing strategy wherein they would want G4 customers to buy an LG AC ;). Why should I? - Battery: has no life! If you plan to use this phone for gaming, net surfing, chatting, and of course calling, then please keep the spare battery on charging &#8211; always! This phone can&#8217;t handle even 2-3 hours of usage. Today, I checked the amount of time it would take to charge the battery which was at 15% - it took 2 hours 15 minutes to charge it to 100%. Though the company claim 100% charge in 1 hour 10 minutes. Imagine your girlfriend wants to make a call using your fancy phone, but you tell her to wait because you want to change the battery. How many times have you replaced your phone&#8217;s battery? At least I haven&#8217;t done that even once, but LG expects me to do that with G4. But again, why should I? - Performance: better processor, more onboard RAM, but is it really fast? I really don&#8217;t think so. It&#8217;s just pretty much the same as my previous Sony Xperia Z Ultra. If you are looking for a really superfast phone, well, you might be disappointed. Others have already reported problematic touchscreen issue, so watch out for it as well. With all these issues already, I hope LG really resolves these issues and makes it a real flagship phone, not a fault-shipped phone!"], ["4.0", "woah. . . good good", "Jayesh", "loved this phone.

If the brand is not noticed (printed on the back), it can easily be mistaken for a high end device like a nexus/htc. The phone does not feel cheap in hand at all. No Android device in this segment has such premium looks yet. Good call quality and decent speaker. Sound is a little bit plasticky (very slightly), but does the job well and is loud and clear enough for calls, songs and movies. There are 3 back panels provided in the box. A bright red, a white and a black. All 3 complement the phone pretty well.  Pros:  Feels perfect in the hand thanks to its 4.5 inch screen, unlike devices with 5 inch screens, that make it difficult to reach the other corner of the screen with one-handed usage. Screen is pretty sharp and has decent colours.  No bloatware and minimal pre-loaded apps. Customized and smooth UI.  Almost 6 GB available for apps/media. Capability to move apps to external storage (micro SD card).  Volume rocker and Power/Unlock buttons are on 2 different sides, making it easy to use with one hand, the thumb for the power button and the index finger for the volume buttons. The buttons do not wobble and the built quality is pretty decent.  Good viewing angles in all directions.  Comes with a factory installed screen protector, a glossy one.  Cool gesture access to apps (customizable to any app), right from the lock screen.  Expandable memory, OTG support and wireless display capability with compatible TV's/HDMI dongles.  The 2 sim card slots are a micro sim and a normal (mini) sim each. This is pretty useful in case you need to pop in someone else's sim card into your phone. Both the sim cards can work on a 3G network, so no more swapping sim cards just for 3G data.  Audio enhancement option, for better quality output through the 3.5 mm jack.  Cons:  Although the battery is a decent 2000 mah, it does seem to be draining faster than expected. Charged it to a 100% and is already in 70's, in less than 3 hours of initial setup and app installs.Below medium screen brightness. This was however with both the sim cards installed, and a lot depends on the signal strength.  The feather buttons on the bottom of the screen DO NOT light up. Thats such a bad bad thing. It takes a little getting used to. Lit buttons are a bare minimum expectation on any phone. The buttons do glow a very bright Red outdoors.  Rear camera quality is average. Front cam does the job for video calls and decent outdoor selfies.  Earphones in the box. Not worth mentioning about..  Slight heat near the LED flash during long usage and while charging, but negligible.  Need to remove battery for sim card and sd card removal.  Final words: One really cant complain much about anything, keeping in mind the price point this was launched at. Excellent value for money given the premium design and decent specifications. A definite buy, specially if this is your first android phone, or maybe a second phone, at least to show off the killer looks ;)  Antutu score: 18472"], ["1.0", "Need someone to repair the phone", "Amit Vasudeo Kulkarni", "First of all I could not connect to internet using this phone, secondly I could not find any service centre of Salora.

I had planned it as a birthday gift and had done some research on mid range smartphones for a month or so before zeroing in on this one. It provides more bang for the buck than any other phone in its category. Ok, some of its attempts are very Indian like the games etc., which coincidentally reminds me of Nokia's much fabled 1100 launch 10 years ago, but overall its a wholesome package when one compares the Samsungs of the world. No wonder why Samsung is steadily losing its market share with its overpriced phones (I had bought a Galaxy S Duos las year and it runs like s***!).  The pros of Canvas Doodle A3102 are its size, the display (ok, for those who are looking for real crystal, seek out Apple 5s) and the features that they provide for a little over INR 6.5k with a free back panel and screen protector thrown in for good measure. The battery's chunky and can run for 5.5 to 6 hours with a bit of everything, calls, videos, surfing, games - you name it. There a several customizations in the Android 4.4 that are available only in INR 10K+ phones and can be compared with the mid level HTC phones.  The cons are few - the camera is good but the colors are a bit mellow, the touchscreen is sometimes unresponsive (gamers beware) and in my case, the back panel did not fit in snugly in my handset.

Yeah it's true that Lumia 435 comes with 1gb ram but it simply doesn't have the cpu nor the gpu to fully capitalize on. Since this is a windows phone the 512 mb of RAM would be more than enough for all day to day usage and only while gaming on high graphics the defieciency of RAM maybe felt. People looking for a good phone at this price (irrespective of the OS i.e Windows or Android) go for Android one for 5.5k or you can even wait for the Redmi 2 that's expected to come in a few months for 6k.

I am not someone who plays games on phones but this MediaTek processor is not a slouch. Any current generation high end processor will be enough to perform day to day tasks without a hitch and I am someone who believes that we dont need gazillion cores to use a phone. People crying out loud for its bad camera performance should try it again after the firmware update. The Autofocus is improved considerably and it takes fine pictures now. You can play with manual settings to adjust the shutter speed and ISO levels to get a perfect looking low light shot.  Let me give you a short background about where I come from. I bought the S6 on the launch day itself and faced the infamous pink tint issue on the screen. Got DOA done from the service center and the replacement device turned out to be worse than the original unit. Sold the hideous phone at a loss of INR 9k. So much for the so called Samsung flagship! Look at the general thread of S6 on XDA, people are crying all over this pink tint issue.  Then came the iPhone, the so called God of all phones (BULLS**T!). Got the 64gb version and again ran into an infamous issue faced by many iPhone users. The screen was literally popping out of the metal casing right out of the box and made clicking sounds while typing messages. While Apple is busy milking huge profits out of customers, the least I expected was stringent quality control. Apple users make fun of companies like OnePlus and dont realize that their iPhone may have been manufactured right next door in China.  I am a happy camper after today's purchase since everything seems to be perfect build wise on HTC and its the best I've used till date, quality wise. This comes from a person who has used flagships after flagships since 2011. Unless you aren't bothered about development and are not into custom ROM's, M9+ is a good buy and I would highly recommend it. If you are someone who cares about custom ROM's and a spanking camera on the phone, this one's not for you. This is the most underestimated phone amongst current flagships and I would highly recommend it to anyone to cares about experience rather than benchmarks or names like Qualcomm. Qualcomm seriously messed up with their SD 810 in a hurry to bring out a 64 bit SOC."], ["5.0", "things you should know before buying", "REVIEW GUY", "Recently bought the beast...the phone is really amazing...

Looking at camera is excellent HTC is done with the Ultra-pixel primary camera, now they have fitted a 20.7 MP camera, which is manufactured by Sony. Yes, it is the same camera you can find in Sony&#8217;s flagships. This camera also comes with the RAW image capture and 4K video recording. HTC has been building some of the best built phones of the world lately, with the previous generations&#8217; HTC has made a name for itself and set a bench mark with the build quality of the phones. They haven&#8217;t gone a bit back with the build quality in the new HTC One M9.

The S-LCD3 1080p screen that is the same that is found in the previous two generations of the phone.

The refined design is gorgeous, and the upgrades included in Sense 7 lend it a mature feel that's missing from rivals' attempts to customise Android. It's also incredibly quick, and it's good to see that HTC has staunchly resisted the temptation to drop microSD expansion. That alone should persuade a good section of buyers to get their wallets out.It has one of the better cameras in the business, if not the best. The M8 had the best camera at the point of time, the M9+ does not have that badge on its chest. The phone works well in all scenarios and is very powerful. However, like most other top-end phones these days, the M9+ too has occasional heating issues. Battery life is a serious concern too. The HTC Sense 7 UI gives a high degree of customisation that you can play around with. And the battery life is good to last a full working day.  If you are one of those people who want to show the world that you have a top-end phone that looks like one, the HTC One M9+ is one of your best bets. It is an investment, especially with all the metal in the phone.

So when M9 Plus was released many saw this as the real successor to the M8 thanks to better overall specs - despite it sporting a Mediatek chipset.  Processor : M9 Plus is powered by an MT6795T chipset while the original M9 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 on board which is very well known to be suffering from heating issues.Performance-wise MT6795T is very good ( 2.2Ghz Octacore ). RAM : 3GB RAM makes multitasking and gaming a breeze. Display : M9 Plus gets slightly bigger 5.2 inches screen with QHD Resolution ( 1440 x 2560 pixels, 534 PPI ) while M9 only has a 1080 x 1920 pixels ( 441PPI ) screen. The screen is glorious to look at with good viewing angles. Camera : M8's Dual Camera which is missing in the original M9 makes an appearance on M9 Plus. However the camera performance is not that better than the one seen on the older M8 or the original M9. Don't get me wrong, M9 Plus's Camera is still good, but since its a new phone one expect it to outclass the older gen phone which is not the case according to many reviewers online. Software : HTC Sense 7.0 UI on top of Android Lollipop. Battery : Any phone with a QHD Display will need a very huge battery to power up all those pixels for the whole day of moderate usage. Since this only packs a 2840mAh Battery, you would find it hard to get through a full day. Unless you are travelling, it's not that difficult to charge your phone these days, so it's not going to be a big concern for many. FingerPrint Sensor : Yes M9+ has got one at the bottom while the Original M9 doesnt come with one.  Should you buy it? If you are satisfied with M8's Camera, then you would be more than happy with M9+ 's camera. I would say this is a better buy than the original M9 since many users are complaining about heating issues with that one. If i am not mistaken, many buy HTC phones for their build quality and HTC sense UI. If you are among those, you wouldn't be disappointed with the purchase.  Other Phones to Consider : Samsung Galaxy S6, Apple iPhone 6 and LG G4 have better Cameras.

At this price range this phone is good enough to give basic Android experience. Tested Wireless, Bluetooth, Mobile data, camera, music & FM radio, all working fine as expected. While browsing net or opening some App it lags a bit sometimes, but it is obvious since the RAM is only 128 MB. Have never opened WhatsApp & Facebook, I know it will lag or hang, so there is no point trying to push and as for me I didn't buy this phone for facebooking or to use WhatsApp. I bought it as a replacement for my 4 yrs old Nokia 110 and to use it as basic phone, with some Android capabilities. The phone call quality is surprisingly crisp & clear. Sound is bit on the lower side, but the quality is enough via bundled earphone for casual listening. Touch screen fine and quick in response, sometimes a feel of slow response may be experienced, but I think it's only because of small amount of RAM. Play Store is not there, it may be have been purposely left. With amount of 256 ROM there would hardly a space for it. So, installing App will only be through apk downloaded through other mobile and transferring it here. Transferring data is no problem, you could do it via Bluetooth or by plugging the phone into PC via bundled micro USB cable and port. But, remember try not to install too many Apps, resource hunger Apps should be complete no no. Install what you really require, chose Apps with as small footprint as possible. Don't expect Angry Birds to run here. Try to utilise as much as possible the bundled Apps instead of installing  heavier Apps with similar functionality. As for me, I install, FastNote for note taking, Opera Mini for browsing (but it seems default browser is much faster), Quick  Pic for Gallery replacement, here too default picture viewer is much faster, Es File Explorer, the default file manager suffices, but incase I need to transfer files via wifi I'll need it, a Simple Unit convertor and lastly a battery percentage indicator. The rest of default Apps like calculator, calendar, Gmail etc are OK and fulfills my basic requirements as replacement for Nokia 110. It has no video player, but which dolt will buy this phone to watch videos. About battery life, I charged it full yesterday and as of now after almost 24 hrs it still has 55% left, mind you I not a heavy user, only an average user.

The black version is especially striking because of how stealthy it looks. The sides are curved and have a non-slip matte finish, but the flat back doesn't lend itself to a very comfortable grip. There's a scratchy seam all the way around, where the edges curve inwards to meet the rear.  The snapdragon 615 SoC powering this phone is now common in phones that cost less than this one, but it isn't by any means a slouch. The only issue I had was that the upper half of the rear of the phone became noticeably hot after just a few minutes of even ordinary use.  The camera turned out to be one of this phone's strongest points. It handled complex exposures really well and the photos came out with a fair amount of detail intact. I was happy to see that compression and noise artefacts were well under control. Even in low light, the camera managed to reproduce better details than i usually see.  Finally, I had to test Sony's claims about how waterproof the Xperia M4 Aqua is, and so i left it for 10 minutes in a shallow basin of tap water. Not only did it continue to run while submerged, but it showed no signs of trouble whatsoever after being patted dry with a towel. The touchscreen doesn't work underwater but you can use the camera thanks to the physical button. Waterproofing is a fantastic feature at this price level, and you won't have to worry about getting wet in the rain or about any accidental liquid damage.  While clearly not competing with the formidable Oneplus One  and the like in terms of specs alone, Sony has packed enough features and usability into the Xperia M4 Aqua Dual to justify its price tag. Sure, you aren't getting the fastest processor or the crispest screen, but there's a world of difference in terms of polish. You also get a more-than-decent camera, excellent battery life and waterproofing without the inconvenience of flaps over every port.  Of course, it wouldn't hurt this phone's chances if it was priced a little lower. Already, it's selling for slightly less than its launch price, so keep an eye out for deals. Sony has proven that it can put together a compelling package without jumping into the price war."], ["3.0", "Nice mid range phone for camera and music lovers.", "Bharat Mishra", "I ordered this phone from amazon I have never purchased a phone in this range so this was really a huge decision for me to take. That's why I am a bit disappointed with the phone regarding some drawbacks that it has and those are: 1. The battery backup is not up to the mark and cannot last for 2 days by any means, it gets discharged even when we are not using it. 2. The upper half part near the camera of the phone gets heated up even when we are using it normally for chatting or browsing internet, and the battery drains like anything at that time, this is a huge drawback for a phone in this range and from a brand like sony. Looks like we have to use it in AC rooms only while playing games or using large sized apps. What is the use of a phone so costly which gets heated up so badly, this might be due the water proof design of it but that feels like I have been cheated because I was really excited to get a 2 gb RAM phone in sony but this phone due to this heating problem is a disappointment. 3. It also hangs sometimes when gets over heated or sometime without any reason. 4. Not at all suitable phone for gaming purpose.....that's really a sad thing for me.  Also I would like to mention the pros of the phone those are: 1. Camera clarity is awesome as expected from a Sony phone, and the front camera is also great for selfies. 2. Sound is also great in the original earphones, wish they would have provided with the in ear earphones, but this is also good. 3. The phone works smoothly except when gets heated up. 4.

Xperia weighs much higher on display.In case of speed, processor of Xperia C(though from mediatek)is much superior to dual core processor of grand duos. Quad core processor plays smoothly full HD videos, multitasking which results in usual hang problem in galaxy grand duos but in Xperia C, so far i have not come across even once any hang problem after using the same almost for 2 months. Weight is also lower. Grand weighs around 200gm where as Xperia is around 180 gm. On battery front also Xperia C outweighs Grand Duos. Grand Duos has 2100 mAh batter where as Xperia has 2390 mAh so even after whole day use of whatsapp, hangout, Facebook etc, battery back up is nice and over 1 day it lasts.Moreover, in power management, it has Stamina Mode which disables data and wifi when screen is off. This feature is really wonderful as sometimes i don't need to charge phone even after two days. Additionally low batter mode becomes active soon after battery level reaches 15% and then it disables all functions in order to save power when battery level is very low.

Here is my experience so far-   The overall build quality and the form factor is very good. I have the white one and I find this very elegant and stylish except the notification light which is relatively less visible. The back cover is harder to open, you have to be careful with that. The display quality is good unless you have used FHD/Amoled before. Dual sim functionality is handy but changing sim preference is a bit cumbersome. There is no dual dial button in the dialer, you have to change the sim preference first to make call from another sim. The call quality is very good and the external speaker produces enough sound. The battery life is very good, i get 24hrs+ of battery life.   Now about the internals of the phone. By not going in mediatek/snapdragan debate , i would say the performance of processor and RAM is very good. I haven't felt any kind of lag till now. Casual games play effortlessly, graphic outputs are also good. There is a concern with the internal memory. You get only around 1gb. I am left with only about 200mb after updating the inbuilt softwares. There is an option to install your apps to SDcard, but I have found that not all apps install by default to SDcard even though the preference is set to SDcard install location, i had to do that manually by going in the apps section.   Overall the perfomance of the phone is very good. You can always do the minor tweakings with the software to suit your needs, its and Android after all.   I am very happy with Amazon.

Average Camera too.", "mac", "Xperia C is the first Sony device powered by a Mediatek processor. Xperia C is powered by a Quad core mediatek MTK6589 processor and Power SGX544 GPU.  Is it worth buying this product?  If the price of this device was around 15K , it would be the ideal phone to buy. But Xperia C is priced at 18K+. If you can give Rs 2000 more or so you can buy a 1080p Full HD Screen device with a massive 4000mAh battery and a better processor ie Xolo Q3000.  Even at Rs 15000 you can get better performing devices,with an updated Mtk6589 processor clocked at 1.5 Ghz named MTK 6589 Turbo. Xperia C ships with an older 1.2 Ghz mtk6589.  From many reviews online it is concluded that Xperia C's camera performance is average. The 8MP seen in other Sony devices is different from this one. Xperia C can shoot and play 1080p videos natively though, thanks to this processor.  Will this get Kitkat update? Probably not since this is a Mediatek device. You cant even unlock the bootloader of this device like you do on other Sony devices. Roms like CyanogenMod,AOKP,OMNI,Paranoid etc are almost impossible to develop since mediatek devices source code has many issues.  Update : Sony has released a 4.2.2 Update for this phone. - Improves the camera quality a little bit."]], "title": "Sony Xperia C (White)"}

So I immediately returned it and now when I want to know what is the status of my phone, no one gives a clear reply, no one knows anything about it and as of now my number is also blocked by them so I am not able to ask anybody about my phone.

Battery backup. 3G on, surfing, downloading, reading, FB, Twitter, whatsapp, Youtube video..all sorts of things together..and it will last day and half...and if you cut some of the above activities from time to time..it will last 2 days. Remember to close the apps when not in use, and you will save more power. It has &#34;stamina&#34; mode and power saving mode, and it almost accurately indicates how long more the battery going to last. Battery is inbuilt though, i.e., you cannot separate it from phone.  2. Stylish look and built. Back cover is pretty thin, and as like all other sony products, handle with care and love. Volume rocker, power on off, 3.5 mm jack, charger slot.  Micro SD slot is in the back, you have to remove the back cover to insert microSD card.  3. Great volume and sound. The walkman feature does not play all types of music files though, you better download google music, which will play all extensions. The speaker is loud enough to be heard from other end of the house in same floor.  4. Processor speed. 1.2 GHz, will be enough. I did not have any lag or anything so far. 5. Touch is smooth, better than Moto ones, better than samsung ones. 6. Answering Machine!! Oh ya, those who are used to US style answering machines, you will love it. Those who don't..start the habit. You record your own voice and ask the callers to leave message. 7. Tons of apps, album has option of revisitng old photos as cover photos, Xperia has teamed up with facebook and twitter to make things a bit easy for beginners. It has a application Sketch inbuild..show away your painting skills when you have time, or kill time while waiting at the bus, airport or not interested in a meeting :) 8. LIV sports and SONY LIV is there..all SONY TV shows are there.  Cons: 1. I assume you are not buying this phone for the camera quality, cause I did not. While it will serve your purpose of brightly capturing the moment, it is not the greatest 5MP camera on earth. Front camera is VGA quality, so you better depend on your friend's phone while taking a selfie or groupfie.  2. NFC. Unless you have some other phone with NFC features, it is not of much use.  All in all, if you plan for a smartphone around 13k budget go for it. Brand matters, and look matters. Especially in the age of fast decaying smartphone batteries, it will put a smile on your face. The battery really works, believe me."], ["4.0", "Alert Save Promotions Proof from Amazon before you Buy !!", "SARFRAAS SHEIKH", "Before I can share a review of this phone I would like to share important thing below PLEASE READ I had bought this phone under FREECHARGE recharge promotion offer by seller Techfone and fullfilled by Amazon. wherein I was supposed to received Rs 2000 cashback in 15 days from purchase. After 3 weeks there was no sign of recharge voucher. I contacted Amazon customer care I was told that the promotion was running on different dates than what i had purchased. Actually this promo was running for 3 different periods on amazon. Luckily I had saved the amazon webpage in PDF format. I called again customer care to receive the same reply so I sent this pdf to them. It is only then they agreed I was eligible and confirmed that they are escalating the matter and would get back to me . 3-4 days past no reply so when I called customer care again the same story that I am not eligible. I couldnt take this longer so I wanted to complain regarding customer care and I got email id for &#34; resolution &#34; where you can complain in your not satisfied with customer care. At resolution also I got same reply that  I was not eligible for this promotion. I was feeling CHEATED so I sent the same PDF to resolution email id and had informed them that if after seeing this PDF also I have informed that I am not eligible than I would knock the doors of consumer forum.

There are several software issues in this phone. Mediatek Hardware are not meant for good performance it seems. This phone has bad audio quality in headphones, no matter how good your headphones are. Xolo's headphones are of inferior Chinese quality. Also Company promised Kitkat update in July first week, and till now it hasn't arrived yet, September is about to start. Also the worst part, Just pray that you don't have to visit any Xolo Service Center in India, You are going to have a mental disturbance and sense of loss. Worst ever services. Also, for the minor issues like replacing battery, They take more than 35 days, that too is not guaranteed. Xolo should work on its customer care services, they are very rude and unprofessional. I would not recommend Xolo at all, instead you must buy any already well established Brands, pay a little more, but you would enjoy the services.

When I brought it up again, they said come after half an hour. I went after 3 hours. They had charged my phone and it seemed to be working again.  On 7th December, 2014, it stopped charging again. If I sat with the pin and hold it tight it would charge. Not otherwise.

That is the case with every new product. Now it has been priced reasonably.

(It does lack ClearBlack display though. And also Glance Screen feature isn't supported.) &#8226;Nokia Music subscription is for 6 months with Lumia 625 and 3 months on Lumia 720. &#8226;Lumia 625 is 4G ready, Lumia 720 supports only 3.5G at the most. &#8226;Lumia 625 has a faster processor (1.2ghz dual-core) than Lumia 720 (1ghz dual-core). This results in smoother overall performance. &#8226;Lumia 625 comes with Nokia Amber update pre-installed and BlueTooth 4.0 pre-enabled. &#8226;(Most obvious point) the screen on Lumia 625 is larger than that on Lumia 720.  And yes, Lumia 625 has FM radio. Some people have wrong info.  Yes, the Lumia 720 has better cameras and supports wireless charging, but you need to understand that a product can only provide you so much in the price you pay for it. And no product is perfect.

I have purchased this phone recently on a great deal from my friend. Getting straight to the point, it's one of the best phones when bought at 8999 currently. If it exceeds 12K again, don't bother coming to this mobile as I feel Moto G 2nd gen is the best in that price with better features and most importantly stunning on screen picture quality.  EcoSystem: --------------- I am a owner of 3 different and major mobile OS platforms IOS, Android & Windows OS now. I recommend this phone to those who don't give a damn about the number of Apps present in the App Store, as Windows store currently has only the famous social media apps available. Believe me you don't have GOOGLE MAPS, but there is Nokia Maps which comes on board and does a decent replacement job. Free MS Office apps like word, excel, power point & guess what OUTLOOK!!!  User Experience: --------------------- I personally loved this phone with a steady OS running on it. Never seen lags till date and was very refreshing for eyes to ones that got used to IOS & Android. There's a secret that Nokia kept us away from I observed floating touch on this phone, the reason could be I was hot ;) it's the principle behind Capacitive touch screen. I felt the screen resolution is on a lower end end when you watch videos and pixels break easily and visible to eyes. That's only the biggets disappointment I guess as a phone priced at 17K MRP should have got it's most visible part correct :D Camera is the hidden upsleeve trick, it has one of the burst photo modes and you will love it. Pease update to 8.1 as soon as you have this phone it's really better than 8 and for a better user experience, the background theme is really superb :D  My final call, If you are a person of patience then you really have to wait for the next gen Lumia phones like 730 at this price range.

Windows phone OS is just a growing software, it needs improvement in many respects. Few examples would be swipe type, extensive customization, app availability. But I would say the interface is pretty fast compared to a slow, hanging android OS. Till now I couldn't install apps into SD card, which in fact fills out my phone memory( available 4GB). So basically I cant download movies using the YouTube app or Movies App.  Battery: This is one reason why I like this phone pretty much. I usually get a 20-24 hrs life with 3G internet always on(except sleeptime ~7 hrs. Otherwise I'd get a 36-44 hrs with normal usage. That's pretty good compared to Samsung phones and other phone is Lumia series.  Build quality : Excellent as it caused no visible damage as I've clumsily dropped it to hard floor atleast 5-6 times. But take it to be granted. Compared to Lumia 520 and 720, it has a better build quality.  Music xp : Produces good quality music using the WH 208.  The music app lets you download millions of songs ( if your SD card allows you to) for free for six months. After that you could renew the nokia music acc. Gotta try out with my new Sennheiser HD 439. It also fares well with Nokia BH-111.  Nokia camera : The app pretty much allows you to learn various aspects of digital photography.

The E1 has better specs and better performance than the old one,and is one of the best 'branded' budget device coming under Rs10000.  Performance : Even though this only has a dual core processor and 512MB ram,the performance of the device is excellent. Many games like Temple Run,Riptide GP2,Dead trigger etc ran without much issues thanks to Adreno 302 GPU on board.  Some Notable features and issues 1) A dedicated walkman key on the top. 2) Camera is just a basic 3MP auto focus one with No led flash.Only WVGA@30fps Video is supported. There is no front cam.Overall disappointed. 3) The build quality of the phone is excellent,doesnt look cheap at all.The back cover has a matte finish which gives it a nice grip to hold the phone. 4) Apps CANNOT be moved to sdcard which means you are left with 2GB of storage for apps. 5) Viewing angles are OK,not that good. The brightness fades when playing tilting games like Riptide GP2. 6) Android 4.3 Jellybean,and 4.4 Kitkat update is expected. 7) Only 512 MB ram. 8) On screen home,back,multitasking buttons. 9) Phone is thicker than many other budget devices. 10) Li-Ion 1750 mAh battery - If you are a heavy internet user,not enough to get you through one full day.

Overall a good branded budget device ,far better than those budget devices offered by Samsung,both in terms of performance and build quality. However,you can get better 1GB,quadcore devices from indian manufactures like Micromax,Xolo etc at this price range. If 'Brand' doesn't matter to you,i would suggest you to get those.

I know its an old model by sony but specs are like launched just recent and not so far.. First i would like to tell you this baby is a beast or can we say it a monster?oh yeah!you got it right a monster! First talk about sammy... I don't know why samsung is selling its flagships over 50k and giving us a lot much disappointing product.. Like an example note 3 which is a very good smartphone in any case but when it comes to performance.. It hangs sometimes when background running apps are left.. My brother have one and he says i will sell it off and such a crap phone... Did you know samsung is cheating indian consumers by selling cheap exynos processor in them.Same note 3 in U.S. Is retailing there with snapdragon 800 chipset and LTE.. Samsung has became greedy now.. Now coming to apple.. Just think, will you get a 1080p display with a high quality sd800 quadcore processor and waterproofing with a name SONY... No. No. No. Answer is clearly no in apple or any big brand... Loyalists of apple are getting home a premium quality good looking standard phone with lack of much..... much.... performance. If you have that kind of money.. You can buy a Z3 without anyone's opinion .. Believe me you'll be delighted to have it.. I know it doesn't have the software like apple but believe me android experience is much better.. It runs on a phone of 4k to 60k and they have their own interface.. Haters will hate... If you wanna buy iphone so can buy it for sure.. No problem.. But you will be missing performance you deserve...anyway... Now.. We all are familiar with specs of the phone and if not you can read it above mentioned on the site ...nothing diffrent than written on the website.. Now coming to the components and specs definition----> #processor- A snapdragon 800 chipset with krait 400 quad core processor clocked at 2.2ghz each.. What else you want in a sub margin of 20k... If you want latest specs with less price or few more price... you can go with brands like oneplus one and lenovo who offer better specs at just 2-3k diffrence.. The phone doesn't hang after installing a hell of applications. Well this chipset is fast even it is old.. The sd805 is out now and sony will be launching sd810 in its Z4 tablet. #ram- better than S4.. Didn't let the phone to hang.. Unlike all samsung phones even with 3gigs ram are continously lagging machines.. But always 60% ram is used and this lead to power consumption of battery.. #Display-One word only....EXCELLENT YES! You heard that right its EXCELLENT..a very great 1920*1080p display with 342ppi density... Colors are great.. Not like the note 3 which produces fake mostly fake colors.. Watching movies in 1080p resolution is world got transformed into the eyes.. Yes its outstanding... #speaker- not much loud like htc with boomsound.... due to waterproofing but it do give audio close to htc boomsound and very clear audio.. Yep there is only one speaker in the bottom but it is loud enough... After all you won't use it as a loudspeaker in a party.. But when you connect speakers to it.. It gives mind boggling sound.. I'm surprised by the headphones sony packed with 'em.. They are only bass boosters.. Not much beats found when listning.. Thank god i have philips she3590bl headset which gives awesome sound.. #build quality- a nice build quality but i'm afraid of cracking the screen as mentioned in many reviews.. The body is made of hard shatter proof glass in papers but some people listed it cracks for no reason.. So i've bought a tempered hard scratch proof glass screen for my phone and that is .33mm thick.. You'll need a jack hammer to break it. #magnetic dock dk30 free-yes sony gives magnetic dock free with the phone but only which are packed with latest imports... About the dock..it is good to charge wirelessly your phone and protect its flaps from wear and tear for waterproofing... #flip cover-sony is no more giving flip cover with latest imported product.. I got the dock charger which is more valuable than muvit 6-700 bucks flip cover.. #games-an adreno 330 which is used in nexus 5 also.. A good experience of gaming till date.. No lags in playing asphalt and dungeon hunter.. #apps-sony packs small apps which are useful as well as their signed apps which are available on google play are pre installed. #interface-much closer to stock android of motorola and nexus.. I'm on kitkat 4.4.4 and about to recieve lollipop... The kitkat update came sealed in the Box due to latest imports.. #web browsing-good netwoking with 3g on all day with stamina mode.. #battery backup-nice but not the best.. After all for such huge screen battery is not sufficient only 3050mah. When screen is on it consumes 70% of the phone's power.. Charging is fast and stamina mode is brilliant. When i left the phone over night with 3g on.. It was only 75% and when i put it on next day.. It was 73% remaining. Stamina mode also let us keep the apps aside which will get data services even after screen is turned off. #camera- as you know the worst things are putted at downside only... Really worst 8mp camera i've ever seen.. Even moto g2 have 8mp but clicks very nice pictures.there are pixels roaming on the screen while capturing in indoors.. While outdoors it gives pretty decent pics in daylight only.. Front camera is good for video chat. Just saying-i've purchased the phone from authorised sony dealer and got the magnetic dock free and also got the latest imported and packed product with latest updates. So no complaint with that.. For 19k i think its a steal..and due to self cracking screen rumours.. I've also purchased insuarance of syska worth rs.1299 bucks on their online website. I know the online sites are selling it with lesser price but they are giving the phone with price written 46990 and mine with latest import has 20990 and it has dock charger free. Strongest competitors of this phone with the price and their pros and cons- *HTC desire 820- display is 720p,13mp,octa core sd615 *oneplus one-china brand phone,sd801 octa core,13mp *mi4-heating issues,china brand *note 3 neo-cheap exynos processor,not performance oriented *lenovo vibe x2:cheap mediatek true octa core processor,china brand *huawei honor 6:well no doubt it is similar to 1+one but these brands can't be trusted. *z ultra doesn't have a decent camera and also doesn't have flash but.. I can live without any flash and can capture pics in daylight.. Also i have nikon digicam so i don't need phone camera.. M not a camera s#cker... Oh i didn't mentioned that the screen is huge but i get used to it in 1/2 hour and now the phone is just fine to hold.. Once you will get used to this phone,all other phones like S4 and grand will be a kiddie for you.. This is the biggest screen phone in the world right now....  Thanx for reading"], ["5.0", "Beyond doubt, the best secondary phone/phablet/tablet device in this price range", "Wim", "I bought the Black one about a month back. This is a year old model, a bit too early for its time perhaps. This was Sony's flagship last year, but didn't sell much. Sony is clearing the stock before bringing the next generation out, and hence the price-cut last month. Which makes it a mouthwatering prospect and you're wondering whether to fall for it. Well, I did. And so far, I'm loving it!  There are enough reviews on the net, so I'll quickly let you know the Pros and Cons.  - The screen is super sharp, great for watching movies or reading books.  - It's big enough to read books in the proper format, but also portable, so reading while holding in one hand is comfortable for quite a while. Also, its small enough to carry around in your pocket (albeit large ones; fits a jacket pocket like a glove).  - Talking with the phone held to your ear is very inconvenient, as expected. Bluetooth works perfectly (it's apt-x compatible, can transmit stereo audio).  - Takes a micro sd card up to 64GB, storage is not an issue.  - Can be used as a proper phone, unlike some tablets with / without voice calling. Skype etc. work perfectly on both data and wifi.  - Battery life is decent, gets me through the day easily with moderate to high usage (I do have the stamina mode 'ON', which is recommended for a secondary device)  - Processor is a beast, will play any game or movie you throw at it. Has enough RAM and other specs to be relatively future proof.  - Camera is ok in bright light, absolutely useless in the dark. Do not get this if you care about taking pictures.  - Sound is good through the earphones, horrible through the mono loudspeaker (really Sony? no Stereo on a flagship?!)  - Sony though has promised the Android L update for the Z Ultra, and I will hold Sony to its promise until proven otherwise (should get the latest and greatest android by early 2015!)  - I also received a wonderful flip cover free with it, which was a surprise because I didn't notice it being mentioned anywhere on the Amazon listing page. Thanks, to whoever was responsible for including it!  - When I started the phone for the first time, there was a horrible yellow tint in the screen. But Sony had addressed this issue earlier through firmware updates and the phone will automatically take you through a couple of Android iterations. It will then allow you to change the white balance and I prefer a blueish tinge, which was easy enough to set with the new-found controls!  - Oh and before I forget, the phone's dust proof and water resistant. Build quality is superb, far better than any tablet or phablet in this price range. Looks beautiful in the included flip cover. Looks wise, it's worthy of a ~45-50K phone, which is what it was launched for last year.  All in all, it's a great media consumption device. With the price-cut, it has suddenly become very good value compared to say, the Nexus 7. But would I recommend it as a phone? I would hesitate doing that if this is going to be your primary device. It's a great secondary device, by far the best that you'll get in this category and price range. I love it because its easy to carry all the leisure stuff around, plus I can also get some work done in a pinch. I particularly love the wonderful screen that makes reading and browsing a pleasure. Five stars at the current price of ~20K. Get it before Sony clears all the stock."], ["1.0", "thing before u buy mobile from online", "sivannarayana", "Don't brought mobile from Heera Digitals, i have booked one sony xperia z ultra on 15.11.2014 and i have received mobile on 17.11.2014 morning at 10:45 i felt happy that movement but the pack is not packed properly there is no amazon tape seal on that and just a plastic cover packed and sent. after opening the mobile i felt so much angry and so much disappoint that the mobile what i received is used one. by seeing visually we can easily say its a used one how, amazon allowed like this i got surprised. following are the identified proofs to say its a used one. 01. in charging point there is no cover. 02.

Before I get to the meat, there are a few caveats.  1. I bought the phone at &#8377;23,000 when it was retailing for around 30k. (at the time of the review, Amazon was selling it for a shade short of &#8377;20k)  2. I use it more for playing games, using it as my online shopping device and occasionally for calling.  3. I bought it with my eyes open. I knew it didn't have a flash and I am never a sucker for phone cameras or for that matter any camera.  4. The stats mentioned below are with Stamina mode enabled. However, many apps were give permission to sync. Whatsapp, Telegram, EBay, Gmail, and Amazon.  5. I use it mostly indoors, so the weak performance of the screen outdoors isn't a problem for me.  Now the review.  I am an avid tech user. I overclock my PCs. Use custom ROMs in most of my devices, have a jailbroken ipad and the Z Ultra is rooted but with the stock rom and by heavens, does it impress!  Battery: Under moderate usage (3G always on), it gives me a screen time of close to 5hrs (4h57m) and chugs along for 3 days, without complaint, before the battery warning pops up.  From a 100% to 15% on just standby with about 30 mins of screen time, (3g always on) it lasted a week!  Gaming:  The Snapdragon 800 series and 2GB ram do a fantastic job. I never tried any of those racing games, but playing Hitman Go and Leo's fortune simultaneously while being on whatsapp and about 10 other apps running in the background never slowed the device.  Hitman Go / Leo's Fortune / Monument Valley marathons saw the device buckle and beg for power in 3hrs. Not fantastic, but with a 3000mah battery, I will put that under impressive(I use a Note 3, which I wish showed such resilience).  Looks:  Always loved the device and still continue to do so after 4 months of use. Each time I hold it sans its flip case, I marvel at this gorgeous slab.  Build Quality:  Absolutely no complaints. In fact after having used it, I am seriously considering gifting myself the Z2 tablet. (Looks like it is going to happen very shortly)  Updates:  From being a Sony hater, now I have become a very vocal supporter. I am running Android 4.4.4 and Sony has promised a Lollipop update to all its Z devices. Agreed it might be some time in the coming, but it surely is!  The Cons:  1.Not much love from XDA interms of custom roms. 2. Tap to wake is desperately needed 3. Mushy power button (taken care of by the MiKey) 4. Insanely well made. Makes you want to hold it quite often.  At 20 big ones, it is a steal. Buy. Buy. Buy."], ["5.0", "Xperia Z Ultra : Worth every penny spent!!", "Sunny", "This has to be my best tech purchase this year. Got it for a great deal @Rs.18680 (Amazon Fulfilled) and this phone is worth every penny spent. Like they say, someone's pain is someone else's gain. So those who widely panned the Z ultra for its sheer size and impracticality forced Sony to give it away for a massive discount of less than half its original price around Rs.45000. For content junkies like me, the size was a boon and slipping it into my chinos was never a problem thanks to its ultra slim profile. In slim/skinny jeans, it is bit of a tight fit, but still never unmanageable. Girls may have reasons to crib given their shallow jeans pockets, but guys should do just fine.  This phone was ahead of its time when it was launched in 2013, and it is still pretty relevant even mid-2015. Its real world performance is pretty much up with the current flagships, so it is bargain at this price. Similar spec-ed Snapdragon 800 devices from Tier 1 companies like Samsung, HTC, Nokia (Lumia 1520) etc are still selling around the 35k mark.  Anyways, here is my take on the pros and cons of the Z Ultra.  Pros : 1) Snapdragon 800 2.2Ghz Quad core, 2 GB RAM, Adreno 330, 16 GB in-built storage and expandable memory. These are flagship comparable specs at a bargain price of under Rs.20k!!  2) Super gorgeous and massive 6.4\" Full HD (1080p) screen with one of the best color gamuts out there. The colors just pop thanks to Sony's X-Reality and Mobile Bravia 2 engine which do a great job of rendering brilliant colors. It will bring a smile on your face every time you turn on the screen! I'm coming from a Samsung Note II and being used to the brilliant blacks on the AMOLED panel of the Note II, I was not expecting the Z Ultra's Triluminous Display to wow me exactly, but boy how wrong I was! The X-Reality does a great job of making the blacks the darkest out there, almost comparable to AMOLED panels and the whites are just so much brighter and better than AMOLED.  Even though the screen is massive, the individual pixels are absolutely not discernible to the eye. HD Movies just pop, photos look gorgeous, reading on the device is a pleasure and games render beautifully thanks to the more than capable Adreno 330 which is also employed in the One Plus one and many other flagship devices. Overall, I can say, I couldn't be more satisfied with the quality of the Z Ultra's screen.  3) 3050 mAh battery is more than enough for a day and half, sometimes 2 full days with moderate usage. Heavy users can still churn out a day's worth of runtime from the battery and Sony's brilliant battery optimization feature called Stamina and Ultra Stamina mode. Gives me 6.5+ hours of screen on time on Lollipop, which is pretty good by all means!  4) The build is impeccable. The phone is IP58 certified for being dust proof and water resistant upto 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. The piece of shatter proof glass slab in the front and back and the aluminium chassis to hold it all together give it a premium feel which is such a far cry from the squeaky, plasticky Samsungs of yore. There are absolutely no squeaks from any where in the device and it just feels like a solid piece of metal slab in the hand. I call BS on some people saying the glass cracks on its own. Unless you subject it to impractical and undue pressure or are just carelessly throwing it around on your desk, I dont see that happening. This device looks every bit like its built to last! And well, did I mention at 6.5mm, this is just sexy slim! ;-)  5) Official Lollipop update 5.0.2 already available for Z Ultra. Even though I hate Lollipop and the overall material design with whites spread everywhere, this could be a plus point for you. I much loved the dark Sony themed Kitkat on Z Ultra. Anyways, the device has taken to Lollipop very well. Apart from the occasional hiccups which are inherent with Lollipop across all flagship devices, the performance is stutter free and smooth.  6) Sony's ClearAudio+ DSP and Walkman app is second to none in Audio quality. I can hear way more detail in my music than I ever could with my Note 2.  7) The bundled earphones are pretty darn good when travelling, and I use a Grado SR80e when at home. I couldnt be more satisfied with the sound quality. :)  8) Network performance is great and I havent faced dropped calls and people on the other side said they could hear me loud and clear.  9) Newer imports are coming with the charging dock which is immensely useful if you do not want to open the charging lid everytime. Unfortunately, back when I had purchased in January, it was coming with a flip cover from Muvit, which although useful to keep your device safe, isnt as great an accessory as the current bundled magnetic dock.  10) You can use any felt-tip pen or pencil as a stylus with the device and draw to your heart's content on the expansive screen canvas, take notes  etc. No dedicated stylus needed like the Note series from Samsung.  Cons: 1) The 8 mp primary camera is not the highlight of this device. It is decent, but not great. Even then, with lollipop, the photo quality has improved drastically from Kitkat days. It has more to do with Sony's photo processing than the lens itself as the same Exmor RS is used on a lot other flagship devices which take brilliant pictures. Flash is missing as well. I'm not really a shooter, so I couldn't care less. The front cam at 2MP is good for selfies. Again marred by Sony's photo processing. Maybe in future updates it will be fixed. See attached image for quality of photo. Its not too bad honestly.  2) Loudspeaker is not loud enough. With Lollipop, Sony, for some unexplained reason did away with X-Loud which did a good job of enhancing the loudspeaker, ear piece output. So you have to carefully choose the right ringtone so that you hear it out on the streets. Hopefully X-Loud will be re-implemented in updates coming up.  3) The charging port, sim slot, microsd slot etc are all under lids to keep the device water resistant. So it could be an annoyance opening and closing the lid everytime to charge. But believe me, you get used to it pretty soon and it doesnt bother anymore.  4) Size, as mentioned earlier could be an issue to some in daily use.  5) Although this is more of a current trend and not really a con, I have to mention that the battery is not user-replaceable.  6) The black one is a fingerprint-magnet.  I guess that covers my take on this awesome device! I'm every bit satisfied with the Z Ultra and would recommend this phone wholeheartedly to anyone who is okay with the size. Also, I couldnt be more satisfied with the overall buying experience, thanks to Amazon Fulfilled and Tecki-Home (Seller)."], ["5.0", "Great phone. one can use this phone as", "Rama Kiran", "Great phone. one can use this phone as, 1.

This same processor is seen in Canvas Magnus,which is Rs 7000 lesser. It would have been great if they had this powered with a powerful qualcomm processor instead. 4) 2 GB Ram 5) Head phones coming with it are not in-ear ones. A flip cover,screen guard and an OTG cable are included in the box. 6) Huge Battery - 4000mAH, such a powerful one is necessary since it has a huge 1080P screen. It can last 2 days of average use. 7) Accelerometer, Magnetometer, Ambient Light Sensor, Gyroscope and Proximity Sensors on board. 8) Camera - Rear Camera is good,but not that great.Front cam is quite good for video calling in good light. 9) 4.2.1 Jellybean - Thats pretty old now. Hopefully this will get Kitkat update.

I am a big fool because even after reading so many bad reviews about xolo q3000, I purchased it. But I do not have any complaint about amazon service. it is just fantastic. I got the device within 24 hours after ordering without paying even single rupee extra.  Display is very nice and crystal clear as it is full HD display. Device is really fast and never hangs. Design is also nice.  Now here are the issues Build quality is not good. Back cover is very thin. Speaker quality is poor. Camer is 13 MP but it is equivalent to 5 MP camera of branded mobile. (Micromax 8 MP camera is even better than xolo camera) Power button issue. Sometime power button doesn't work so it is not possible to lock the device by pressing power button. After some time this issue gets resolved automatically. Very unstable network coverage. it gets changed frequently and really poor reception. When there is no network coverage, Device gets unlocked automatically in pocket and starts dialing emergency numbers. it seems software issue (I have kitkat 4.4.2). When we start video camera, device gets  overheated so video camera can not be used for more than 3 to 4 minutes. Device also gets overheated when you play HD games on it. (it works perfect for normal play store games). When call is going on, device automatically start wifi, gps, bluetooth and may time put call on hold automatically.  I have seen above issue so far and will post if I find any new thing.  Now service center, Dont even think to go to xolo service center. if you have any problem with your device, give it to your children as a toy but do not got to service center because they takes 3 months to send the device to delhi for repairing and they also take 3 more months to repair it. I also heard that many people didn't get device back even after a year.  So don't get tempted to its bit 5.7 screen and 2GB ram. There are many alternatives for this device in market.

So when I was planning on buying a new phone, I knew which one to get.  Pros:  *Premium build quality- Doesn't feel like a 15k phone. The grip is perfect, matte finish keeps away stains. Well rounded edges. The finishing is just about perfect.  *Display: The display is crisp and works as expected. I was worried if a device with such a huge screen would have messed up on the display part. But its spot on. After playing around in the Lumia Color Profile for a while, one can alter the display to his/her liking.  *Camera: The camera is great. Images taken are filled with details. The default camera app is a little disappointment, but try the Lumia Camera to see the real deal. The default app had some issues with low light images, but the Lumia camera with Rich Capture resolved that. I'd suggest going through a youtube tutorial on the Lumia camera app, to get a hang of how it works(because honestly, it does get confusing)  *OS: This phone features the update 2 of the Windows Phone 8.1 ( the last of its name). It is not a major upgrade over its predecessor, WP8.1 or the update 1 but it brings about some welcome features on the table and a variety of bug fixes. It is not the best OS out there, I agree. But the WP OS offers best value for money on its devices in the Low-Mid range section. With options like direct installation to SD card, you could never run out of space, given you have a big enough SD card. In the two days that I've spent with the phone, I already have around 5gb of apps installed on my phone and card. Also the days when the windows store lacked decent apps are now gone. There is a plethora of apps out here on the store, and those that aren't will hopefully be here by the end of monsoon this year. So if the 'Windows' tag is stopping you, trust me you should get rid of the fear.  *Keyboard: Quite possibly one of the simplest and effective keyboards across all OSes. It adapts to your style of writing, your words and grows with it. The prediction is close to perfection. Word flow only makes it easier to type. Also its got a set of in built dictionaries, including Hinglish. So agar aap bhi meri tarah Hindi se English me switch karte hain apne conversations me, aap ye bina kisi jhigjhig k kar sakte hain!  Cons:  *Speakers: The external speakers aren't as great as you'd want them to be. The ringtones and alarms are audible, but could have been louder.  *Charging: Even though the phone offers excellent battery back up, it takes a lifetime for the phone to charge fully! The default charger takes about 3 hours to go from 0-100. This isn't really a problem because even with 50% battery one still has about a day of moderate to heavy usage left on the phone. But for people like me, obsessed with fully charged phones, you will have to adjust a little.  Apart from all that, the size might take some getting used to. Especially for people who are used to smaller phones. Although one handed operation is difficult, its still possible for people with big hands.  All in all, if you are looking for a mid ranger that packs performance with useability and are open to WP, go ahead and get this beast. If you, however love your lags and the phone constantly annoying you with low memory notifications, are absolutely fine with top-grade specs that offer the worst possible performance, and upgrades that take longer than Salman's verdict to arrive, you can stick to MiPhone."], ["4.0", "If u love windows Blindly go for it.... i found more than i expected..", "Shivannadam", "If u love cam and larger display Go for it..... cam=no words to say Process= till now i do't have a problem display=gorilla glass 3=super I can say finally i u love Windows phone go for it... advantage of windows phone is without games and without wi-fi we can play with it.. no boaring"], ["5.0", "Good Phone , specially for Nokia Lovers ....", "Indroneel Dey", "Good Phone , specially for Nokia Lovers .

If you have one best is to get it returned asap and buy new set hope you will get non bleeding screen.  2&#62;The battery is actually 1000mah thats what 3 diffrent tests confirmed.It supposed to be 1800 mah. Again Micromax Did not help and Asked me to callup Cloudtail the seller.  What i liked about Device -light weight. the reason why i bought it and 4.7inch screen seems to work for me -Front Cam -Colours and screen (minus the defect)  Dislike: rear Camera is just average not even good Battery is Pathetic( does not last 4 hours on 3g video call) No Kitkat update.

The phone was available here at Amazon.in at 17,899 with further CashBack with my Citibank credit card. The phone is definitely worth the money. The white looks stunning and the black is equally good.. I went for the white one though! I have graduated from a SGS3 (Android) and was using it with all the possible permutations with a custom ROM and had even used it with the stock ROM for around 7 months. This phone does NOT feel sluggish! The phone is having good speed for my basic tasks. The phone is very good and the best part about it is the HUB. I have never got anything so universal! It integrates everything (However, I would have liked it to include adding a News account to make it almost BB's BlinkFeed [but nonetheless, it is super]). The gestures in the phone make me try to operate my old S3 in that manner too. It is very captivating! I miss it across all my other devices. This one is a game-changer for me. One thing that not many people know! The Z10, or as a matter of fact, any other BB10 device, is capable of SIDE-LOADING any android app. However, with the OS update, the BB10 is now capable of loading any android app in the ecosystem making you not miss any of the apps you loved on your android. This is a great feature for me and I don't miss out on any of the apps. The active frames of open apps are good. I would recommend purchase of BeBuzz Pro on the Z10 as it changes the phone completely! Now, the things on my S3 that I miss here! Notification Bar: I used to use the old notification bar on my S3 too much.. Just so much that every now and then, when I would be within the app, I may even quick reply there and not leave the app. Here, the same is available but with a bit of a change with 'peeking' in to the hub and replying and then returning. However, I liked the Android Notification Bar more as it was customisable as well as gave more information. Moreover, the NB was capable of being pulled from within an App also from Android but Z10 can only pull it down from home screen as within an app, pulling down brings down options for that app. However, BB has promised to provide this by way of a two finger swipe down in the future OS update. The torch: With the recent OS update, the torch was brought in the Notification Bar but due to its limited availability, the same has been very less useful to me. The phone app: Samsung's phone app was bogus and BB is only slightly better. With automatically losing images in the speed dial and occasional bugs that make the search function within contacts non-operational till a reboot, I have ended up calling the first contact in my phone book at least ten times by mistake. Then, I got to understand that with some symptoms showing up, it needs a reboot. Overall satisfied with the phone and giving it a generous 5 stars only due to one thing..

I decided to go for this one, as it seemed to be the clear winner in every department. However, the phone is not perfect. there are a couple of issues with the device that may be nothing to some, but really cumbersome for others.  Pros: 1) Excellent display: The display on this phone is a 2K display, which is better than the 1080P display's which come on most phones. The clarity is just amazing. 2) Great camera: The camera on this phone is 13 Megapixel. It's amazing for daylight photography and video recording (4K), but it's not the best at low light photography. Also, I found the camera to be a bit slow compared to others. This is easily fixable with a third party application, like Google Camera. 3) Build quality, though not the most premium, feels really good in the hand. The phone is really light, and does not feel like the 5.5&#34; phablet that it is. 4) Rear-firing 1W speaker: The speaker on the LG G3 is really good, though it is rear firing. Although I prefer speakers that face you (Like on the One M8), this pleasantly surprised me, as the sound quality is really good.  Cons: 1) Laggy interface: The LG skin on top of Android 5.0 (Yes, the update is out!) is pretty heavy (At least in my opinion) and creates a laggy environment. This can be reduced with some tweaks (Reducing animations and so on) but this is slightly cumbersome for me. 2) Display is a bit dimmer than I'd have preferred in direct sunlight. The auto-brightness doesn't do a good job, but I mostly control the brightness manually anyway. 3) AUDIO ISSUE WITH 3.5MM JACK: This is the MAIN issue I have with my LG G3. When I connect my headphones to the jack, I can hear a background noise when I use the touchscreen on my phone. This is really annoying. However, this is not the case when using Bluetooth speakers/Headphones. This is not limited to my unit, and there are lots of posts about it on XDA. 4) Slightly creaky back: The plastic back on my LG G3 creaks a little bit near the camera port. This issue goes away when I put on the quick-circle case, but is persistent on the normal back plate LG Provides.  Overall, I would give this phone 4/5. One star is knocked off because of the Audio issue, but, like I said, if you use Bluetooth headphones and speakers, this will not bother you in the slightest. I would recommend this phone even with this issue, as there are a whole lot of features to play around with, and the specs are top of the line.

You'll love it absolutely!!!", "Nandan Kulkarni", "I did not go wrong with this mobile. Got it a few days back. Now i'm not a high end phone collector to splurge cash but this one time i needed to make the right move cause I'm going to be using this product for many years to come and this product just makes me feel everyday that I will do so.  I'm not going to go over the specs of this phone as it is available everywhere on the internet. I'm going to tell you the usage experience which I did not find much over the Internet.  The phone is fast! No issues in that. The stock LG firmware is very very good. I mean, generally everything stock is considered bloatware but people never give the time to use it. LG has given some neat apps you'll be using in your daily lives. The home launcher is particularly good. Just enough customizations but not too overwhelming. Perfectly balanced (I'm a heavy android user and have been using it extensively for 5 years).  The Quick Circle case is very useful trust me. Pretty much everything basic to a phone like calling, answering calls, camera, compass, clock and weather, calculator, checking missed calls, health apps etc can be used without even opening your cover!!! yes!! and i absolutely love this feature. It saves me a lot of time and battery. The most useful feature I have used in this phone.  The display is brilliant. Period. Don't worry too much about the negative reviews on the display. In your daily usage you won't even notice it or get to know the negative points of the display. You'll grow to love the display every single day.  As far as heating is concerned, The phone gets moderately heated on heavy usage. LG throttles a lot of stuff to bring down the temperature, one of which is the display brightness. I've found this to be useful and annoying too in some cases.There are ways to override this but I wouldn't suggest it. Rest assured it won't go into this mode in your average daily usage.  The pics that it takes is on par with what I manage on my DSLR. I have no complaints regarding the camera or video quality.  Call quality is excellent on both caller and receiver side. I have found no issues again. Data is fast. By fast I mean, detection is fast and makes usage of complete bandwidth which my old Motorola Atrix 4G could not achieve. The battery drain is manageable. Data drains battery and so is the case in any phone.  Coming to the battery itself, I'm a very heavy user of phone and this phone gives me about a day on my usage, I browse a lot, message a lot so naturally 3G data will always be on as long as I am out of my home which takes most of the day. I watch videos and listen to music and FM while on the go. So i'm very happy with the battery performance. I have been able to push even 2 days on light to normal use. Just make sure to charge the battery to 100% and drain it completely to 0% first 5 to 10 times after you get your phone. It also comes in with built in battery saver mode which is quite nifty. It takes about 3 hrs to go from 0% to 100% charge and about half an hour to get charged to 40% so that is handy if time is of urgency.  I loved the build of this phone most of all. And it feels good to have spent 37k on this phone. The design is beautiful and the phone itself looks elegant. It fits in the hand just perfectly and in your pockets too. It's very light compared to competition. It has a beautiful 5.5in qHD display which looks fantastic. The colors are muted, very pastel like and pleasing on the eye. The bezels are almost invisible which adds to the beauty of the phone. It does not have any hardware contextual buttons but I've not found them wanting in any case till now. I can just about get anywhere in my phone in few touches.  It has SD card support which makes it all the more sweet. It has IR blaster and yes! I never thought it would be this useful. I use it to control my Set Top box. It does support all the major Set Top box manufacturers and it works flawlessly! I'm in love with this phone and it continues to surprise me everyday.  It also comes with the dual window functionality which is handy and useful. I constantly find myself using it. Be it browsing and messaging, mail and browser, note taking app and browser etc., and it doesn't slow down even one bit. It keeps up with my pace. Out of the box it supports only a few controlled applications in dual window mode which is quite limiting. But i have rooted the phone and a simple switch from false to true I can now get ANY app in dual window mode (But for users who are not into that sort of thing, you might find this feature limiting, hopefully they'll fix this in coming Lollipop update).  It also sports a floating window mode, again to only set number of applications but I've never found that feature comfortable since it was introduced in Android.  Coming to the stock keyboard. I LOVE IT! The first thing I do after receiving a new phone or OS is to download either touchpal, swiftkey or A.I type keyboard which I've been using for years now only because the stock keyboards suck and hamper your productivity. But LG has nailed it this time. The keyboard that comes with G3 is hands down the best and the simplest I've seen till date. It is neat, clean, fast and very very useful in the shortcuts and gestures it uses to give you the complete typing experience. As I said LG has balanced this perfectly.  As far as another selling feature Knock Code is considered. It's fun! I say it's fun cause it's fun to open the screen that way. But if anybody sees the way you knock (trust me it's very easy to read the knock pattern) anybody can open the phone. So don't expect your phone to be very secure. But then again you have plethora of options along with knock, like pattern lock, password lock, pin lock and face lock. So use any of those to make your phone more secure. The device wakes up if you knock it twice. I find this very useful than having to find a button to wake it up every time.  It also supports a lot of gesture based commands like flipping to mute a call. The screen doesn't turn off when you're looking at the phone etc etc which I'm using everyday. It is not intrusive and makes my phone experience very very smooth, seamless and enjoyable experience.  Another talking point about this phone is the guest account setup. With a different knock pattern you can set up a guest account for kids, friends who you don't want to be viewing unnecessary content or change your settings. You don't have to use an app or do any sort of time consuming black magic. Just knock it into guest mode! Pretty useful huh!  Final verdict : If you are looking in this range and are looking at Galaxy S5, Note 3, Note 4, Xperia Z3 and LG G3, for the money I'd say buy this, if the S-pen that comes with the Note is not a limitation (You could still buy a quality stylus and use it to take notes)! LG is taking all necessary steps to ensure that it becomes the best in this class and they are looking like committed to it! That's a plus point, considering g3 is the first to get a lollipop update barring nexus6. LG is committed whole heartedly in making it's flagship the best and they have proved it with G3. You will love this device for years to come! Just go for it.  P.S : I'm not a LG fanboy and in fact this is my first LG phone. I personally love Motorola the most and to some extent HTC. I was skeptical about this phone before investing so much money but LG has blown me out of the water. Amazing product!!!"], ["4.0", "Great value, amazing phone.", "gSathe", "This phone is amazing in so many ways, but that doesn't mean it's perfect.  The good: . The screen is brilliant. The text is the clearest ever, and the screen is also bright with rich colours. . The size of the screen means that you can get a lot of text on one page as well. I love browsing the web on this thing and use it more often than my iPad even when I'm at home. . Superfast charging. It goes from 10% to 90% in just over an hour. . The phone is powerful too - it's not the fastest phone on the market but after around a month of using this, I'm yet to experience any lag, or have any apps run slowly or have any issues. . LOTS of smart features. I'm not big fan of OEMs customising Android, but LG has been largely restrained, and the changes that it has made are mostly positive. For example, the knock-to-unlock feature sounds a little pointless, but given that the power button is on the back of the phone, it's useful. The keyboard layout can be customised so you can add punctuation that you use the most often, or change the position of some of the punctuation keys. You can also hold-swipe on the space bar to move the cursor, and that is super helpful when entering URLs for example. . The Quickcircle case that comes with the phone is also more useful than it initially appears. You'll be able to see who's calling, and even respond to calls without having to open the cover, but that's not all. Tap the empty space to see an analog watch, and swiping that reveals call logs - so you can make a call without opening the cover; messages, to read any unread SMS, or activate the camera and take a picture right from the small circle. It's an excellent way of using the space, and I just wish they could replace the watch face with Google Now cards in some future update. . LG has also announced that the LG G3 will be getting Android 5.0 next week, starting with Poland. Even if Indian users don't get the upgrade at the same time, I got the last software update on the same day that it was rolled out in the UK, so I'm fairly confident that we won't have to wait too long.  The bad: . This phone is a little uncomfortable to use one-handed. This sounds like a pretty obvious thing to say considering how big it is, but the size of a phone isn't just about the screen size. I've used the Galaxy Note 4, which my mother owns, and that's actually a little more comfortable to use. When you're sitting at home and reading or playing games, that's not an issue obviously, but when you're on the move and want to make a call, or you're in office and want to quickly reply to a text, this can get to be a problem. There is an option to enable one handed use where the keys move to one side of the screen, and you can rearrange the icons in the dock to have the back button be on the side of the screen you hold the phone from, but these are not really enough to make it comfortable. . It heats up a little quickly - not just when you're playing games, where just about all phones I've used heat up. But even if you're doing something simple like tweeting, or texting people. Keep it up for too long and the phone gets warm. Not uncomfortable, but warm, and that's a little worrying. . The power button and volume buttons are really awkward to use. You won't have to, for the most part. Software workarounds mean that I've had to press these buttons around once a week. But that's just covering up for the fact that these buttons are incredibly inconveniently placed.  The ugly: . The battery discharges too quickly. The quickcharge feature means that it isn't actually a big issue - as long as you keep your charger in your bag. But in general, you're going to charge this phone at least once a day, and possibly twice, depending on your usage. My work is such that I have to take a lot of phone calls, and do a lot of talking on my phone. I use lot of apps regularly as well, and most of this involves using 3G - so I'm definitely a heavy user. That means that I usually bring the battery down to zero by lunch. I charge the phone again in office, and by the time I get back at around 7, it's at 80% again. I get up and the phone's usually around 40%, and I top it up to 100% before leaving at nine. With all my older phones, I was charging just at night, so needing to charge this much is definitely a minus point for me.  My verdict: Despite the fact that the phone burns through battery, I'm really delighted with it. I bought it during the Diwali flash sale and thanks to some gift cards, I ended up paying just around Rs. 27,000 for the phone so it's beyond amazing value for money. But even at its current price, I'd probably recommend buying it because there's so much to like."], ["5.0", "DASHING  PHONE, GREAT LOOK......", "pavan gangal", "Yessssssss, that's what i said.

In box headphones are truly very awesome. Every single rupee on this purchase is buy back seriously after long 15days survey had opted for this mobile. my initial idea was to buy iphone 6 only pricing and branding are plus nothing found impressive.  If some options like quick memo, volume keys placement, guest mode, T action, quick remote, never can be found in any other device,  lets say when you mount the phone to the car holder volumes never disturb at any point, quick memo to note anything like phone numbers, address, anything for emergency, guest mode for kids -bye to bye to apps lock, remote is awesome no need to carry 2,3 remotes in hand works with every LED, DTH box too.  Every single app are designed which are useful to our needs.  Now coming to Z2 beside water / dust proof nothing much impressive. As defects / cons on Z2 which are: 1) loudspeaker volume of voice while on call is pretty low, which couldn't able to handle group discussions, 2) signal strength reception is not all good, if office is 3 floors and when am sitting in the 1st floor never ever used to get.  Finally used every network may be this is the problem but nothing to do with the network.Z2 has this problem not only mine many of them has faced same. 3) No such options like quick memo, remote, and other stuff as above. 4) only best at camera, body build quality which doesn't required at all the times to safeguard mobile.

Neeraj"], ["1.0", "Pathetic after sales support from Sony !!", "Ranjan Kumar Mohapatra", "When Sony Xperia Z1 released I was one of the first customers to buy the handset from Flipkart with lot of excitement...But trust me, I am experiencing pathetic customer service from the customer care and service center department.  Sony being a worldwide brand for electronics and home appliances, every customer expects to get prompt and appropriate service for their products, but in my case I failed to receive satisfactory service for a premium product like Xperia Z1&#8230;..  1. On 24th December when I woke up in the morning I saw my Xperia Z1 display having a crack from inside the cabinet.. There was no damage on the external glass but however, the display had cracked from inside.. A single scratch cannot be seen from the external where the display has cracked&#8230;.  2. In my case the local service center people are asking me to pay 18,000+ rupees to replace my handset completely instead of replacing the display although my handset is under warranty and the display had also cracked on it's own from inside. There is no sign of external damage on the screen.  3. Sony Customer Care executives and Sony Service Center are not well trained and they do not understand customer grievances. They are least bothered about the customer satisfaction and only think of ways to extract more money from the customer. Nobody bothered to give me a callback to update me about the status. I had to keep following up with the customer care helpline as well as the Sony Service Center. I know few acquaintances who had similar experience with Service Center, Bhubaneswar.  4. My handset contained some photographs in the internal storage with my father who died this year and that was more valuable to me. I requested the service center to take the backup of my phone but they refused that it cannot be done as display is cracked .If I can do the data backup after exploring the internet for few hours then why can't the technicians employed by Sony do the same ??? Aren't they qualified enough???  5. While I handed over the handset to the service center there was a small area of damage to the display but when I received the handset from them the area of damage had increased significantly.. I have the photographs available with me..  6. I had heard that Sony Xperia Z1 is a flagship model and during service period the service center provides a temporary handset but in my case no temporary handset was also issued to me.  7. After sending an email to Sony Senior Management in India Sony Head Office Support team sent an email stating I have to pay 50% of MRP for refurbished handset without accessories and 80% of MRP (Rs 28,500/-) for fresh handset without accessories&#8230;.. Prices offered by local Sony Service Center and head office vary significantly which proves there is no baseline price&#8230; Whatever happens to your handset Sony people will simply ask you to pay another 20k -30k instead of replacing the faulty equipment&#8230;  It&#8217;s really frustrating as Sony Customer Service people are asking me to pay another 28k for the handset which is under warranty and the screen has also cracked on its own due to faulty design/bad quality equipment being used.  Trust me guys the service being offered by Samsung for Galaxy S4 which is a comparable model with Z1 is much better than Sony&#8230; Sony is having the worst after sales service&#8230; I would like to request everyone not to go by brand instead buy the products having better after sales service to make your life hassle free&#8230;&#8230;"], ["5.0", "Excellent Phone!! GO FOR IT!!!!", "Deepak B.", "Well.. I bought this phone in December 2014, ya it's been 6 months since i am using this phone. I was lucky enough to get this phone at a price of 37500(remember!! mentioned price was during Nov-Dec times) through Snapdeal website wherein the accessories includes SMART BAND & CASE!!.. Let me not waste much of your time,So here are my observations after using it for 6 months.  Pros: 1. This phone looks simply brilliant. Glossy appearance gives an added advantage(for white color handsets). 2. Great display. Looks truely HD. 3. There is no lag or hang as seen in typical samsung phones(apologies for samsung lovers). Buffering is also gud. 4. Video playback is extraordinary with clear sound through front facing speakers. 5. Battery back up is also gud. moderate usage will result in atleast 40hrs of backup. You will easily get through the day without any worries(as i mentioned, it is for moderate use). Here is detailed analysis made on battery back up. Low usage(Calls,messages,surfing for few mins to hours)- Battery will easily last for two days. Moderate Usage(calls,msgs, surfing for couple of hours, gaming for half an hour)- easily lasts for a Day. High Usage(Extreme gaming, regular calls and msgs, surfing for couple of hours)- Lasts for 6 to 7 hours. 6. Ofcourse!!! This phone is water resistant. You can boldly take it into pools (on my experience till date) 7. It comes with stamina and ultrastamina modes for power savers for extended battery backup. 8. Camera!!!! No words to explain it.. Sony are the true masters in this.. If you really want to compare its camera then pls do it with SLR's and not other phones :) You get pleanty of features to use!! 9. Though it is 160+ gms it doesn't feel heavier. 10. Phone is sturdy enough. Screen doesn't breat out easily as seen in typical nexus phones.  Cons: 1. Too much Touch sensitive. Sometimes if there is water drops or finger prints on the screen,it automatically starts selecting some icons withour your knowledge if the phone is not locked. 2. Glossy look lead to fingerprint magnet for black and purple phones. 3. Earpiece given along with this phone is not satisfactory. No Noise cancellation headset provided. 4. Phone gets overheated while shooting a 4K video or playing game for more than half an hour of 20 mins.  Conclusion: There is no doubt that this phone is simply a superb in all aspects except some few minor cons as specified. I would definitely suggest you to go with this phone. However if you are a game lover i suggest you to stay away from this phone as it burns your skin from overheating :D. Hope this review will be usefull.

Also, if you're really interested in taking good photos, consider getting a decent digital camera; there's only so much you can do with a phone.) +The looks of the phone are also quite good. The back covers are very glossy and thus pick up a lot of fingerprints, but overall the phone doesn't look cheap, and the build seems to be sturdy enough.  -The flip cover does not turn the screen on/off when you open/close it. -There's no notification light.  +/- The phone comes preloaded with more junk apps that I like (but not as nearly bad as my old HTC), but surprisingly, at least some of them can be uninstalled. +/- Battery life is about average, neither especially good nor especially bad. I have not noticed any heating at all while using or charging (but again, I don't play games with heavy graphics).  So far, I'm very happy with this phone.

Drain differs on wifi/3g.  2. Supports 4g. In bangalore i am getting 2 bars when on 4g. Guess network has to expand. On 3g i get full network strength.  3. 2Gb ram does its job.

A5 is the first Samsung smartphone with a FULL metal body. I wonder what took them this long to come up with metallic build ones like Galaxy Alpha and Galaxy A5.  #Software : Galaxy A5 is powered by a 1.2GHz Qualcomm MSM8916 Snapdragon 410 Cortex A53 quad core processor and Adreno 306 GPU. It is running Android Kitkat 4.4 out of the box with Touchwiz UI on top as usual. It has 2 GB Ram to help in good multitasking and gaming experience. One new thing in the Touchwiz on A5 is, it now supports themes ( only icons can be changed and there are only a few available now ). Samsung is also bringing in Adaptable Audio, which will automatically increase or decrease the volume in response to the background noise around you.  #Display : It has a 5 inch 720P HD Super AMOLED Display, which is as always good to look at. It offers good Outdoor visibility and Viewing Angles.  #Camera : This has a 13MP Sony Exmor IMX135 sensor. ( 1/3.06-inch). This same sensor is seen in older devices like Samsung Galaxy S4, LG G2, Moto X etc. Overall performance of this sensor is fine and takes good pictures in good light but suffers in low light conditions. It has a 5MP front camera for selfies and video calls.For selfie lovers, it has a 110\u00b0 view, and you can snap a selfie with your voice or palm.  #Battery : Sammobile is reporting, the 2,300mAh Battery on board the A5 performs really well and gives great battery backup.Ultra Power Saving mode reduces battery consumption by shutting down unnecessary functions, ensuring longer battery life from a single charge.  Overall Samsung has put out a good Midrange Metallic Android Smartphone. It would have been great if it had a better Camera sensor, atleast the one on the Galaxy S5. A5 has got a Good Display,and good Battery Backup making it a Good buy for Samsung Touchwiz lovers. Looking at this phone critically though, if you are an S5 or even an S4 user, you should better stick with that rather getting on to this one, unless you are buying this for the metallic looks and a slightly better software experience.  Note: Samsung India website says A5 is a Dual Sim phone while the Amazon Listing here says Single Nano Sim. I am not sure if Amazon is selling a Single sim variant. Sammobile notes on dual sim A5 phones - &#34;you can either insert two SIM cards, or use one SIM card and a microSD card, as one of the slots is common for both a SIM card and a microSD card.&#34;"], ["5.0", "Five Stars", "akshay chavan", "There should also de insorence"], ["3.0", "Good phone had Samsung got the price right", "Amar A.", "With the A series we can conclude that samsung is trying to sort out the design problems it has had for years. With the Galaxy Alpha, the metal body was introduced in Samsung phones but the back was still made of plastic. But A series features full unibody design which gives the phone a sturdy feel(sturdy yet not premium). The RAM is plenty for a phone but what seems to be a point of concern here is the processor, which is comparable to the processors of a few android wear(Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53). What that means is, that while the phone feels snappy in daily tasks, it's exhibits a lacklustre performance in resource hogging tasks like gaming. A great new feature is that the micro SD card slot doubles as a sim card slot to make the phone dual sim. but that features compromises expandable memory.So to sum it up -  Pros- 1. Sturdy build 2. 2gb RAM 3. Interchangeable micro SD(Up to 64GB)/dual sim card slot 4. Nice camera(13 MP rear and 5 MP front), with features like wide frame selfies and animated gif selfies 5. Super slim(6.7mm) 6. Corning Gorilla Glass 4 7. Battery lasts a day no issue, though it is a 2300(Li-Ion) mAh battery. This is because both the screen and the processor are not as powerful so they could do well with less juice.  Cons- 1. Mediocre screen(720p screen in year 2015!! Though it's 294 ppi and it's still difficult to spot pixels from a practical distance in 720p screen, still higher resolution produces more vivid and sharp images, though it is more taxing on the battery, which becomes somewhat significant here as the battery is less powerful) 2. Less powerful processor(Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53) 3. Sound is not good, Samsung should have put the speakers on the side rather than on the back. 4. OTG not supported 5. Android 4.4.4 out of the box(an update may be on its way) 6. Metal back is prone to scratches 7. High price for the specifications  Bottomline This phone has almost the same specifications as Lenovo A6000 but is more costly. The sturdy build and slim form factor makes the phone feel good in hand, but still lacks a premium touch. The camera is good and the comparable brother is Galaxy S5, except for the fact that this phone is 1.2 GHz quad while S5 has 2.5 GHz quad core processor. So, while this phone is launched recently, still it would be a better choice to stretch the budget a little bit and buy the S5, as this phone brings nothing exceptionally appealing to the table except for a sturdy design and a undue price."], ["3.5", "service deatials", "jeyan", "Mobile sepeaker compliant service in quickly pls"], ["5.0", "Five Stars", "vijay", "Excellent"], ["1.0", "... 13th of this month and now its not repsonding like from yesterday after just downloading 20 apps & that ...", "pinank vora", "I bought a SAMSUNG A5 on 13th of this month and now its not repsonding like from yesterday after just downloading 20 apps & that doesnt include games & the retailer says it not my fault and is not co operarting with me i would like to recommend others not to buy any phones from your company as your phone cant work properly for even 48 hrs."], ["1.0", "guyz if you have 25000 rupees, please done buy ...", "shariq", "guyz if you have 25000 rupees, please done buy this phone its a trash can of samsung (save money , save life)."], ["4.0", "Four Stars", "Minal Bhuta", "Good experiance"], ["4.0", "Nice phone very slim.", "Naseem Ahmed", "Nice phone with metal finishing but Sim 2 slot is either you use Sim 2 or Micro SD card"], ["1.0", "received with scratches on the device", "lavnish", "Received in worst condition and scratches."]], "title": "Samsung Galaxy A5 (White)"}

Sony being a worldwide brand for electronics and home appliances, every customer expects to get prompt and appropriate service for their products, but in my case I failed to receive satisfactory service for a premium product like Xperia Z1&#8230;..  1. On 24th December when I woke up in the morning I saw my Xperia Z1 display having a crack from inside the cabinet.. There was no damage on the external glass but however, the display had cracked from inside.. A single scratch cannot be seen from the external where the display has cracked&#8230;.  2. In my case the local service center people are asking me to pay 18,000+ rupees to replace my handset completely instead of replacing the display although my handset is under warranty and the display had also cracked on it's own from inside. There is no sign of external damage on the screen.  3. Sony Customer Care executives and Sony Service Center are not well trained and they do not understand customer grievances. They are least bothered about the customer satisfaction and only think of ways to extract more money from the customer. Nobody bothered to give me a callback to update me about the status. I had to keep following up with the customer care helpline as well as the Sony Service Center. I know few acquaintances who had similar experience with Service Center, Bhubaneswar.  4. My handset contained some photographs in the internal storage with my father who expired this year and that was more valuable to me. I requested the service center to take the backup of my phone but they refused that it cannot be done as display is cracked .If I can do the data backup after exploring the internet for few hours then why can't the technicians employed by Sony do the same ??? Aren't they qualified enough???  5. While I handed over the handset to the service center there was a small area of damage to the display but when I received the handset from them the area of damage had increased significantly.. I have the photographs available with me..  6. I had heard that Sony Xperia Z1 is a flagship model and during service period the service center provides a temporary handset but in my case no temporary handset was also issued to me.  7. After sending an email to Sony Senior Management in India Sony Head Office Support team sent an email stating I have to pay 50% of MRP for refurbished handset without accessories and 80% of MRP (Rs 28,500/-) for fresh handset without accessories&#8230;.. Prices offered by local Sony Service Center and head office vary significantly which proves there is no baseline price&#8230; Whatever happens to your handset Sony people will simply ask you to pay another 20k -30k instead of replacing the faulty equipment&#8230;  It&#8217;s really frustrating as Sony Customer Service people are asking me to pay another 28k for the handset which is under warranty and the screen has also cracked on its own due to faulty design/bad quality equipment being used.  Trust me guys the service being offered by Samsung for Galaxy S4 which is a comparable model with Z1 is much better than Sony&#8230; Sony is having the worst after sales service&#8230; I would like to request everyone not to go by brand instead buy the products having better after sales service to make your life hassle free&#8230;&#8230;"], ["5.0", "Five Stars", "Fardeen Khan \"king khan\"", "arrowsom"], ["5.0", "A Smartphone which fulfils almost every need !", "Vaibhav", "Short & Simple Review - Sony came back with another flagship named 'Z3' which I think is a excellent phone.

It is her first smartphone and she did not even know how to operate a touchscreen phone earlier. The best thing about windows phone is that even a new owner can get used to it in no time. My son, though just 7, is quite well versed with smartphones and loves to play games. He has installed several racing games and one or two games that require high-end graphics. What I was pleasantly surprised was how this phone plays all those games. There is no lag whatsoever. the screen in itself if quite decent, and way better than xaomi or Micromax phones. The camera is another big plus. Though it is just 5MP it takes better pictures than MotoG (2nd gen). 1 MP secondary camera is also bright and clear enough for video calls and you would not notice any graining and drop in quality during video calls. The battery life is good. Though my mom is not a heavy user at all, but with her mild and my son's gaming usage, it lasts about 1.5 - 2 days comfortably. Last but not the least: build quality is amazing for an entry level phone. The plastic is pretty decent and it does not feel cheap. Overall a simple basic design, but an effective one."], ["3.0", "Go for Lumia 638 instead at 7k! Why find out in the review below!", "Sayan Sarkar", "Nokia 532 comes equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdargon 200 1.2ghz quad core MSM8212 proccessor with an Adreno 302 gpu. This is just okay for the price of 6k-7k. Yes it's definitely a good initiative from Microsoft to provide an alternative lumia for the budget seekers but I think this phone is dated. Plus why should someone go for Lumia 532 when you can get Lumia 630 with a Snapdragon 400 cpu and a clear black 4.5 inch IPS screen for 6k.Yeah it's true that Lumia 532 comes with 1gb ram but it simply doesn't have the cpu nor the gpu to fully capitalize on. Since this is a windows phone the 512 mb of RAM would be more than enough for all day to day usage and only while gaming on high graphics the defieciency of RAM maybe felt.Even you can go Lumia 638 with all the internals of Lumia 630 plus the 1GB of RAM is available at 7k, i.e the same price of 532! Since not only the performance, even the screen quality of 638 is much better than this. People looking for a good phone at this price (irrespective of the OS i.e Windows or Android) go for Android one for 5.5k or you can even wait for the Redmi 2 that's expected to come in a few months for 6k. Microsoft introduces this phone at a time when budget users are spoilt for choices with so many alternatives at their disposal. Had they done it a year before then it might have attracted buyers but not now. plus their pricing policy is also strange! They are even competing with themselves by making Lumia 630/638 sell for a similar price! Only pro of this phone is that it is a dual sim variant while the 638 is not.

The E1 has better specs and better performance than the old one,and is one of the best 'branded' budget device coming under Rs10000.  Performance : Even though this only has a dual core processor and 512MB ram,the performance of the device is excellent. Many games like Temple Run,Riptide GP2,Dead trigger etc ran without much issues thanks to Adreno 302 GPU on board.  Some Notable features and issues 1) A dedicated walkman key on the top. 2) Camera is just a basic 3MP auto focus one with No led flash.Only WVGA@30fps Video is supported. There is no front cam.Overall disappointed. 3) The build quality of the phone is excellent,doesnt look cheap at all.The back cover has a matte finish which gives it a nice grip to hold the phone. 4) Apps CANNOT be moved to sdcard which means you are left with 2GB of storage for apps. 5) Viewing angles are OK,not that good. The brightness fades when playing tilting games like Riptide GP2. 6) Android 4.3 Jellybean,and 4.4 Kitkat update is expected. 7) Only 512 MB ram. 8) On screen home,back,multitasking buttons. 9) Phone is thicker than many other budget devices. 10) Li-Ion 1750 mAh battery - If you are a heavy internet user,not enough to get you through one full day.  Benchmarks Nenamark Score - 56fps - Impressive. Antutu Benchmark - 12900 - Quadcore devices like Xolo Q700,Q700i scores the same. Quadrant - 5680  In the Box - USB charger,Cable,Normal headphones.  Overall a good branded budget device ,far better than those budget devices offered by Samsung,both in terms of performance and build quality. However,you can get better 1GB,quadcore devices from indian manufactures like Micromax,Xolo etc at this price range. If 'Brand' doesn't matter to you,i would suggest you to get those.

Music doesnt appear to be muffled as it is when the speaker grill is on the back side. Listing down the features I liked:  =&#62; The phone look and display are very attractive, (specially the white one) =&#62; Music is good. =&#62; No lags found in the transition of the pages and quite smooth. =&#62; Processor and RAM is adequate for daily use. =&#62; Battery saver inbuilt. Its enough to take you throughout the day provided your not doing heaving WIFI and graphic usage.  Features I did not quite like.  =&#62; The camera is not something to praise about. Pictures appear flushed and details missing. (But thats fine you cant expect good camera in a 5k phone) Front camera is ok for a VGA. =&#62; Transition through the menu has a issue which I am unable to resolve. The transition of the menu page icons are random. There is a way to change the settings from the menu but even after changing we cant see the change. They still appear random. =&#62; The UI is like the Iphone UI. The stock Android UI like nexus which was in the previous Xolo models was cool and fast.  Overall its a nice phone for some who wants a basic android phone for just 5k. I wont say I am as impressed as A500S but yea this phone does the job.

The least likely one to challenge the Alpha-dog but just as slim and sharp as the rest of its Galaxy A teammates.  And it's not all about the looks - with LTE and Super AMOLED available across the range, the Samsung Galaxy A3 has the same 64-bit chipset as the A5 and the same high-res front camera as the A7. Most of the other specs are of course duly toned down but the A3 is a pretty credible midrange package on its own.  It comes in single and dual-SIM flavors, which is a popular combo in the midrange - but does well to offer cat. 4 LTE on both.  The high-resolution selfie camera is still quite a novelty for Samsung - the A3 is among the few very recent phones to have one.  A Super AMOLED screen of qHD resolution and a 4.5&#34; diagonal and a Snapdragon 410 chipset under the hood are looking competitive enough.  Main disadvantages    On the pricey side at launch   Relatively low resolution display   Non-removable battery   Dual SIM model has less RAM than the single-SIM model and no NFC   The second SIM slot on the Dual SIM model doubles as a microSD slot, so you can only use it with a SIM card or a microSD card, but not both simultaneously  Where the Galaxy A3 comes short is display resolution. However, the Super AMOLED display should make up for the relatively low fidelity with great contrast and punchy colors.  The Snapdragon 410 chip, which isn't going to break the sound barrier, but is of the new 64-bit generation and won't be dealing with too much stress considering the screen resolution.

However, I'm pleasantly surprised at how good this phone has turned out to be! The phone has a premium look to it and a screen guard and basic phone cover protecting the back is included in the original packing. I can vouch for the battery which lasts for 1.5-2 days on heavy to medium usage with WiFi and mobile data being switched on all the time. The touch screen is as good as any android phone including the Nexus 5 in terms of responsiveness to touch and ease of typing etc. Even though the RAM is only 1GB, I haven't faced any lag or slowness is using or switching between apps. The internal memory is 8GB and almost all of it is available for installing apps, downloading music, videos, photos etc. The phone runs on Android 4.4 KitKat customised by Lenovo and is expected to get the lollipop update soon. Audio quality is very good if you use nice earphones. The one supplied with the phone is pretty basic and I use skullcandy earphones to listen to music. The only drawback  I find is in the camera where image quality is nowhere close to Nexus 5 (same 8MP) or Apple iPhone 4s (maybe 5MP). However, I'm yet to see a sub 10k mobile phone which clicks great pictures. The camera isn't awful by any means though. It is passable and efficient and the quality really suffers only in low light.

The other 2 handsets that ships with similar battery are Lenovo P780 and Xolo Q3000,but both are priced much higher than this.

The display is a 5 inch one with a resolution of 480 x 854 pixels,which is not that great,but OK. The viewing angles are also not that great. The processor/gpu combination is powerful enough to play many of the games without much issues and the jellybean on board runs smooth.

I would only say one thing &#34;Take a note of this masterpiece&#34; .  display: The 5.7 inch,Super Amoled screen  is exceptional and the best so far of any smartphone. Quad HD resolution of 2560x1440 pixels, 515 ppi.  makes the quality sharper and top notch.  Camera: The camera on the Note is really fabulous.It holds a 16 megapixel camera, with better OIS and ofcourse it has a very good ability to take better photos even in low light conditions. The front facing 3.7 megapixel shooter has also been improved from the S5. As of android note 4 holds best pair of cameras.  Performance: Qualcomm 805 processor promises to be one of the best in the present market and will remain so for atleast say 1 year   -no lag with touchwiz   -Webpages load faster   -switching between Apps is quick(no delay)   -Gaming performance is the best  ever  seen in  a smartphone.   -And the best part it doesn't get heated up  Battery Life The battery life is also pretty good , but not the best.You can get a Full day on a mid to heavy usage. Taking the 5.7inch and heavy performing GPU and CPU the battery is doing a good job.  Another feature about  Note 4 is the rapid charging ability.I haven't tested it though . As tested by Samsung it gets charged to 75% in just 40-45mins. You will get the rapid charge USB cable included in the box .  Samsung have done a great job on the S pen and of revising the pen and it's software.The pressure sensitivity is better than ever and the pen feels smoother and better on the 5.7 incher.  IR blaster which allows you to control your TV ,4G Support,and the Samsung gear is also a plus point. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is the most well finished device with a top notch build quality.

I still miss my HTC one X+ for the quality of music it generates far outdoes the competition. Samsung should consider this as a big agenda in their next release. Also they should think of a better cover which will add feather to it's evergrowing mobile popularity. The device has an amazing display with 5.7 inch super smiled display.

But it was one time, I haven't faced the issue again. * Google Talk (from BB world) isn't working for me and since Hangout/GoogleTalk can't be side loaded, I don't have GoogleTalk on my phone.

{"url": "http://www.amazon.in/Sony-Xperia-T2-Ultra-White/dp/B00I0SMGYM", "reviews": [["4.1", "Xperia T2 Ultra - Good Midrange Phablet", "mac", "Xperia Ultra T2 is a mini version of Sony's expensive and premium phablet Xperia Ultra.  &#60;-- Device Specs & Highlights --&#62;  # Display - 720P Screen, 6.0 inches (~245 ppi pixel density) - Triluminos display and Mobile BRAVIA engine 2 are included to get a better viewing experience. The display quality is good, offering good viewing angles and the touch response is great. The screen is reflective,which means you might find it difficult to see under direct sunlight.  # Chipset - Qualcomm MSM8928 Snapdragon 400 , Quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A7 CPU - Not a high end processor,but powerful enough to offer a lag free experience. Adreno 305 GPU helps in good gaming performance. # Ram - 1GB Ram ensures good multitasking. Many devices at this price range has started to offer 2GB ram, so pretty disappointed that this only has 1GB on board considering the price at which this is sold.  # Non-removable Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery - With this big battery,the device can easily last one day of moderate usage.  ## Build Quality & Performance The build quality of the device is good,but different from other Sony higher end flagship device. Even though it is plastic,the overall look of the device doesn't look cheap at all. The back panel is very glossy.The performance of the device is also quite good. The processor/gpu combination can power up many high end games without much issues,but for some you need to put the graphics level to medium to get smooth gaming experience.The same cpu/gpu combination is seen in devices like Galaxy Note 3 Neo, Huawei Ascend Mate 2,HTC Desire 816 etc.  ## Software This is running Android 4.3 Jellybean and Sony is plans to upgrade it to Android 4.4 Kitkat. The UI is closed to stock Android,except some useful modifications from Sony. Since the UI is not heavy,like Samsung's touchwiz, the overall experience is lag free most of the time.  ## Camera 13 MP Rear Camera that supports 1080p video recording at 30fps. 1.1 MP, 720p recording @ 30fps is supported.  Overall quality of the camera is OK,not very good or not very bad,good enough for your sharing needs. It offers many modes seen in other sony phones like Superior Auto, Timeshift, Ar effects, Background defocus,Sweep Panorama etc. Superior Auto mode is limited to take 9MP photos only though. Expect washed out,noisy, below average photos indoors and in low light.  ## Some Things to Note 1) Micro Sim 2) Applications cannot be moved to the sdcard. So you are limited with the 4.3 GB (out of 8GB internal storage) to install apps and games. 3) Speaker volume is not High. 4) USB OTG is supported. 5) NFC support is there.  ## Verdict Overall a good midrange phablet from Sony with an excellent screen and good battery backup. This is not that powerful as its big brother Xperia Ultra and only has 1 GB of ram. If you want a big branded device, this is a good one to get. If size doesn't matter to you, i would suggest getting a Moto X which is coming at the same price point offering good performance and software features. If brand is not an issue for you, then you can find a lot of indian branded devices with competitive specs in this price range."], ["4.0", "Amazing", "Bakul", "First thing you feel after opening the box!

I don't want to set your hopes or expectation high,  the pice changes the perspective of the experience .Having said that if you are going to buy this mobile for 3k or less, I guarantee, you will be happy with what it gives you, if not please don't buy it. 1.3 ghz dual core processor, 512mb ram, 4gb rom (1gb for app installation, 1.2 gb user usable other allocated for system.), kit kat out of the box and front cam :P .

The default display setting is rather dark, so you need to increase the brightness and tweak one or two other options to get a very crisp display. 3. Audio quality is excellent.

Unfortunately, it stopped working after two months and I gave it to the Sony service center for repair. They replaced the PCB of my phone after two weeks waiting period. Once I received the phone, I could notice that only Sony headphones would work with it and none of my Skull candy or Sennheiser headphones would work. Whereas, before repair all my headphones other than Sony and Sony itself used to work with my phone. I complained about it to the service center and they behaved in a rude manner and rejected my complaint saying that I am supposed to use only Sony headphones with it and nothing else!! I took the matter to the higher authorities at Sony but, no one followed up on my request. This might be one in a hundred cases and I was unfortunate enough to be a victim of Sony's negligence towards customers. Anyway, I bought a Samsung Galaxy S3 in an exchange offer and is using it since April 2014 without any regrets!!! I was deeply hurt as I lost Rs. 11,500 for buying a Sony Junk and using it for just 3 months. But, I could at least recover some of that money via the Samsung exchange offer!!

The packaging of the phone was very shabbily done and the outer box was in taters when it arrived. Inside the amazon brown box, the phone was loosely kept without any bubble wrap of protective packing. The packing was worse than what our local vegetable vendor sends his products in. For the packing I give this 1 star (thankfully, the phone was not broken on arrival). The phone also didn't work reliably for the past 1 week. I had to travel to New Delhi with it and there were many spots where the phone just wasn't able to receive calls or make calls. This problem was not consistent but would happen at least 15 times a day when it would just stop receiving calls. It was very hard to figure out the problem, as there were times when it would still receive and make calls. This problem stopped once I returned back to Mumbai (This was not a roaming problem, as I was using the same SIM card in my older Nokia phone and it was able to make and receive calls just fine from those same locations). For the performance of the phone in the first 2 weeks, I give it 2 stars. Finally, the design and aesthetics of the phone are better than any other phone I've come across so far. So in the &#34;looks&#34; category, I give the phone a 3 or 4 star.  In summary, I would be highly cautious in buying any expensive item from amazon again."], ["4.0", "Its nice phone except its low internal memory", "Sreejith", "Sony Xperia M is the best mid level android phone you can buy in the market. It have all the nice specs that you might expect in mid range, hi-range phones. Display is of good resolution and have good viewing angles.  I have heard lot of negative reviews that viewing angle of this phone is very bad. But comparing to other phones, its not that bad.  5MP camera is of average in nature. HDR feature is good to experiment with. Video recording of 720p is also average. But remember to activate image stabilazation.  WIFI and bluetooth easy to connect and its only take seconds to search and find networks.  This phone can only hold micro sim, which made me some problems initially. I was using normal sim, which have to cut into micro sim to use on this device.  The one and only problem I notice with this phone is, low internal memory. With lot of crappy unwanted applications installed by Sony, available internal memory was way low to 1.3GB. I uninstalled those unwanted applications. But still 1.5 GB internal memory which is too low for this phone. Games like NFS most wanted and Asphalt can't be installed due to low memory. Even I am using 16GB class 10 card, no applications and games be installed on memory card. I don't know its by Sony or Android jelly bean limitation, but one thing I can say it's really frustrating. Only option I have is to root phone but that eventually gonna void my warranty.  Call quality is good. Speakers are on bottom, so if you place it over a surface, some times you may not hear ringing(if you have a low ringing volume, noisy atmosphere, and mild ringtone). It happened to me many time.  Notification light is a good add-on that you get with this phone. You can customize the color of notifications as your choice.

The build quality is sturdy and without creaks, even though the phone's external materials are made of glossy plastic (fingerprint magnet). It is based on Android 4.2.2 with a mostly stock Android that has light touches of HTC Sense UI (it is not a &#34;full&#34; HTC sense device). The octa-core processor is very fast for day to day tasks - moreover, the underclocked CPU (1.4GHz) ensures the phone doesn't heat up too much. The display is slightly disappointing, it is a regular TFT LCD display and not the better IPS/AMOLED types and does not have any gorilla glass/dragontrail protection. However, it produces a GOOD image with subdued colours (compared to the highly oversatured AMOLED display on my earlier phone). In practice, I found the display and viewing angles on par with Micromax phones in this price range that also claim to have IPS screens.  Multimedia wise the phone does well, HD videos play smoothly enough and the audio quality for music falls into the &#34;good enough&#34; category. However, for music fans, this phone is not a substitute for a Sony or the better HTC phones. This phone does not come with Beats Audio, for example, found on higher end HTC phones. It also does not feature the front facing speaker or the special pre-amplifier circuits found on those higher end phones. It is definitely good enough, but it is obvious HTC focused on the stock circuits for audio playback given by the chipset inside the phone. Music is balanced, but lacks the &#34;punch&#34; that you would notice on an Xperia or the higher end HTCs (it's more like one of those tier-2 Chinese/Taiwanese brands in this sense - Acer, Alcatel, Gionee etc.).  Voice calling is again in the &#34;good enough&#34; category. Voices are clear and noise is adequately suppressed, however, the voices are often not loud enough and sometimes the tones are muffled. There are clear differences between the phones I have used and I can say that HTC can do better than this. The volume of the phone's speaker is good enough but barely audible in outdoor environments in urban areas. Again, &#34;good enough&#34;.  The camera is slightly disappointing, but again takes &#34;good enough&#34; pics for the most part.  This phone is what I would recommend if you want an &#34;HTC lite&#34; experience (BlinkFeed is awesome) in an otherwise average phone with a decent processor and GPU that runs most modern games and 3D applications well. The build quality is definitely a step above the Chinese/Indian phones in this price range, but features wise you can certainly do better.  All in all, I do recommend it. Most of this review also applies to the HTC Desire 620G, the main differences in that phone being a noticeably better camera and Android KitKat 4.4.2 (as opposed to 4.2.2 in this phone). Both phones will receive at least one major update in the next year or so, so I wouldn't write them off."], ["4.0", "Four Stars", "sambandham", "The mobile looks very slim and good looking.

As the name suggests, the most interesting feature of this phone is the huge battery it comes with.  #Build Quality: Good Build Quality overall with a matte finished back panel. M3 is a bulky phone, and is heavy thanks to the Big battery inside. The phone comes with a Free Flip Cover in the Box.  #Display: 5\" HD Display with Good Viewing Angles.  #Software: This is powered by a Mediatek Mt6582 Chipset and comes with 1GB of Ram. I would have loved seeing this powered by an Octacore Mt6592 instead. Like every other Gionee phone in the Market, this too runs their Custom UI - Amigo UI on top of Android Kitkat. This comes with a lot of software additions, and tweaks offering better experience. Hotknot, Double tap to wake up etc are supported. Unfortunately since the UI is quite heavy comparing to Stock Android, expect lags often.  #Storage: Out of 8GB, you get around 2.5 GB for Apps. You can choose SDCard as the Default Installtion Location. OTG is supported.  #Camera: 8MP/2MP. Overall quality of the Rear Camera is quite Good. Front Camera is a Fixed Focus One.  #Battery: The Main reason for buying this device should be this huge 5000mAh Battery on board (non-removable). It can go on and on. The downside is, the handset is bulky and quite heavy. As of this writing no other phones ships with such a big battery.  #Verdict: Buy this for Battery.Overall performance of the Custom UI on this is not that great. Since you can get Octacore, 2GB Ram devices for the Price this is shipping, i would recommend getting those instead of this if Battery backup is not your Top Priority."], ["5.0", "excellent and awesome mobile.", "frankei", "Very good and excellent mobile from gionee,  5 stars for its 5000mah battery itself, paisa vasool. 8 MP rear camera pics r very clear in daylight but not that clear in dark, prossecor speed up to mark,  very good in multi tasks.

But its just a matter of a couple of days of hands on it, I found it is better than my existing android phone. No hangs, no delays, utter smooth operation.  People said that there are few apps for Windows, I found that there are lot of options for normal users. May be for app freaks, they may be less! For someone who is addicted to social media apps like facebook, this is the best phone. Facebook is deeply integrated in the OS.  Touch is near perfect. Performance is superb which I judged by playing Asphalt 5 game on the device, it runs as charm with full details on! I liked the &#34;Kid's Corner&#34; feature, very useful when you have kids around. Build quality is very good, form factor and screen size are optimum. Feels good to hold in hands. Offline maps feature is decent however you may not find it as informative as google maps.  Some features may be lacking (like easy interface for enabling, data networks, WiFi, Bluetooth and Airplane mode), but then there is widget for that. It would be better if this widget comes pre-installed in the OS.  Sound is quite good. Creating and managing playlists is a pain. I am unable to figure out a clean way of doing it yet. But once done that should not bother any user regularly.  Call quality, voice clarity etc are very good.  Overall a very good phone in this price range.

I was never fascinated by smartphones, tablets and other touch screen devices and was very happy with my simple basic mobile. It was only accidentally that i gave it a thought to go for a smartphone after i lost my mobile and my techno-savvy friend advised me to go for this.  The transition from a simplest basic mobile to the Smartphone could never be more easier, thanks to Nokia Lumia 520 and Windows 8.  I do not know much technical bits to appraise this mobile, but i can state many of its advantages from a layman's angle.  1. Excellent build quality- I dropped it on a cement road from my bicycle to find it in three pieces. But nothing was damaged. 2. For it's primary usage as a phone- Excellent voice quality, speaker phone is at its best. Signal reception is also very good. SMS Interface is very different than regular basic phones and i found it to be quite innovative. 3. Screen size of 4' is quite appropriate. It fits in your palm well and goes in the packet very nicely. 4. Display quality is excellent. It may not have the best viewing angle though, but for a single viewer, you get the best. 5. Windows 8 feels amazing. Very user friendly, desktop kind of interface and positioning of apps could not be more simple. 6. It will not be wise to ignore Windows phones thinking that it does not have enough apps. You would find apps for almost all of your needs. 7. The most beautiful feature i found is the Kid's Corner. Here, you can create different profile for your kid. And you will be at peace, while your child is trying her hands at your mobile. With this profile, your child can not make any outgoing calls or can not mend with your important files in the phone.  Though, there are some limitations as below.  1. There is no front camera, but what more can you expect in a budget phone. 2. No radio. But for me, it doesn't matter. I do have best radio apps downloaded in my phone. 3. There is no key to search within mobile, instead there is a key that takes you to the web search engine- Bing. I can't justify a separate key only to search over web. 4. Lack of Dual SIM. Don't understand why Nokia does not have this.  Overall, i found this to be the best smartphone with a budget below 10K. Go for it even if your budget is more than it.

From a user perspective, I really felt Structure of Windows UI restricts reaching to things. Smart phone has to have very user friendly interface from OS and apps perspective.

With Samsung, HTC and Apple leading the Smartphone wars, Nokia was left miles back. Surprising enough, Nokia struck back with its most impressive line of mobile phones till date. Joining forces with Microsoft was a very smart move for Nokia. Instead of developing its own OS, it went for Windows 8, and left all the marketing of OS to Microsoft.  When I heard the price of Lumia 510 (precursor to Lumia 520), I was taken aback. 10k for windows 7.5 phone! Still I waited for an update to Windows 8. That's when Lumia 520 was launched. But for some reason or the other, I couldn't buy it. Then one day I saw the price 6999/- and bought it immediately online. Don't regret it one bit. The best smartphone I ever had.  Pros:  1. Build Quality: Superb. On par with higher line of Lumia series. Matt Finish is just wonderful. 2. Screen size: Prefect for me. At 4\" inches, this beauty is no doubt an amazing buy! 3. Display: While it does not have clear text technology of Lumia 620, it's nevertheless every bit its worth. Only downside  is reading in sunshine is not as clear as Lumia 620. 4. Interface: Truly Elegant.If you think Android/iOS is elegant/user friendly,give this beauty a try. You'll be astounded. 5. Apps: All essential apps available. Though apps are not in the counts of Android Marketplace or App Store, you won't be disappointed as all essential apps we use daily are available. 6. Office 365: Full MS office suit. Though many may not use this, I use MS Word quite regularly. 7. Colors: Amazing bright colors. Could easily give Samsung a run for its money that only launches mobiles in Black and White.  Cons: 1. Front Camera: Not a deal breaker though. At 7k (or even 10k), I expect nothing more. 2. Radio: Not a deal breaker. I usually use Tune In (Internet Radio) 3. Flash: No LED Flash. Now this was disappointing. They could have added it. 4. RAM: 512 MB Ram. Even though processor is 1GHz and Windows 8 demand less RAM, 1 GB could have added more value to the product. Still, no deal breaker at this price :)  In 10k range, this baby easily outsmarts every other smartphone. Give this beauty a try and you won't be disappointed.

Trust me guys, I am using this device & I haven't found any of these issues yet.  I guess those who found such issues are unfortunate enough to have found a faulty piece. Complain to the Sellers guys!!! Not Sony!!!   Coming back to the phone: 1.  It packs a punch with lot's of pre loaded apps which if you find boring, can easily uninstall & free up your space.  2.  Rear camera is good enough, but I found a bit of a noise & distortion in clarity in some of the night clicks. The inadequate lighting conditions might be the reason for this. But yeah, it wouldn't have made Sony go at a loss had they provided a 1-2MP front camera!!! Though I am not much of a Skype person for video calls & stuffs ( more of a Whatsapp & Hike guy), I guess atleast Sony should have gone for a 1-2 MP front camera. I mean, c'mon guys!!! We are not living in the Nokia 6600 age when VGA camera was in the market!!!  3. The 720p picture & video quality is really an icing on the cake. Stream as many videos You wanna from Youtube, you will never be bored or frustrated for resolution & picture quality.  4.  With 2370mAh Battery, Sony has launched this monster with a bang. Nokia is the Undisputed Champion in terms of Battery, but if Sony keeps on launching phones with this much juice in it, the Finnish Giant a.k.a Nokia will be getting some sleepless nights I guess. The only Con I guess is the high charging time in this aspect. Even after the updates both Android & firmware updates, the charging time is still 4-5 hrs, which is a bit frustrating. Still with the 1 day back up, that too after constant calls, streaming, Chats & playing my favourite Clash of Clans, the battery was left with enough juice till midnight so that I can sleep away while the phone is in charging.  5.  When it comes to music, sound quality both distortion & noise free, it was, it is & it always will be Sony hands down!!! With a few enhancing modes available for your twerking, Sony has left no holds barred to provide a cell in the mid level with excellent sound quality, both, for voice calls & music. The only con in this aspect is the Made in Jhumrutallaiya kind of pathetic Headset!!!  6.  The best part though, the illuminating Neon band at the bottom of the cell.

Most of the part, the UI is smooth,but you will find lags here and there during application usage,often due to a low end processor and 512MB ram it has. Even though this runs Android, Nokia has modified it so much so that it would be difficult to see any traits of Android UI style in there. It has a Lumia like homescreen and there is only one button to navigate - a back button. There is no multitasking button to switch between apps which is very disappointing.  ## Software Nokia has opted not to include Google Apps, instead are promoting those apps they favor. So the popular core apps of Android, like Android PlayStore, Gmail,Google Maps, Google+ etc are missing. There are Microsoft apps and Nokia's own popular apps like Nokia HERE Maps included. Whatever alternatives they provide,without the Google Playstore,you are missing a lot of vast variety of apps.

Firstly, what I'd like to highlight is the utter superiority of the phone when compared to others in the same price range, especially the Android Phones. As you may have seen, Android requires a lot of hardware and due to this, low budget Android phones costing below Rs 10,000/- frequently hang and have a very bad user experience. It's been more than 15 days using this phone and my mother has not complained about any of these, although this may also be a result of the extensive customizations that Nokia / Microsoft has done to this particular flavor of Android. A welcome experience though, has been Fastlane, which shows you everything you need in one place. Call quality is good and the dual sim feature is an added plus, considering that dual sim phones of competitors cost a lot more. And as usual, the touch sensitivity is quite good as well. Lastly, please bear in mind that since this is not &#34;official Google Android&#34;, you won't have access to the Google Play Store, but it is possible to use a concept of side loading to install apps from Google Play into this phone (search for this on Youtube). Overall, a great decision to buy the phone."], ["3.0", "Good but could be better....", "Hari", "The nokia's entry into the android scenario is definitlely assuring but has to go a long way on the fronts of usability and convenience.

If your purpose is voice calling this is the best suitable CDMA phone. If your purpose is gaming or pure data usage this is not recommended. Compared to my HTC in price and performance, this is an excellent phone. Price of HTC XC is around Rs.18,000/-, while this phone is less than half of that cost.

So my suggestion is do not buy an expensive product Online....always walk down to a shop where you can get a sealed pack Box and piece of mind. Dont mind if you have to pay extra bucks.  You can see video (search for \"Note 3 Purchased from Amazon.in Seller Electronyx Bazaar\" on youtube)  which I had recorded while opening the courier sent by this seller. You can clearly see the seller has very cleverly stuck the seal on top of an already open box. Seller claims that the seal might have broken in transit, but not sure how can the seal remain intact from outside and not inside. Its genuine cheating.When i contacted the seller he says that if the mobile is defective I can get it repaired from Samsung Service. Just imagine a thought of taking your 1 day new mobile to service centre just because you have purchased a seal broken mobile online. Other option amazon and seller gave me is to return back the mobile. Good idea but seller gave me a heart break saying I will be responsible if anything goes wrong while transit. So I inquired about transit Insurance. Most of the courier companies were not ready to ship such an expensive mobile, one who agreed said they will charge Rs 900 for Insurance and 400 for shipping. And this amount has be to paid by me and not the seller.

Sony being a worldwide brand for electronics and home appliances, every customer expects to get prompt and appropriate service for their products, but in my case I failed to receive satisfactory service for a premium product like Xperia Z1&#8230;..  1. On 24th December when I woke up in the morning I saw my Xperia Z1 display having a crack from inside the cabinet.. There was no damage on the external glass but however, the display had cracked from inside.. A single scratch cannot be seen from the external where the display has cracked&#8230;.  2. In my case the local service center people are asking me to pay 18,000+ rupees to replace my handset completely instead of replacing the display although my handset is under warranty and the display had also cracked on it's own from inside. There is no sign of external damage on the screen.  3. Sony Customer Care executives and Sony Service Center are not well trained and they do not understand customer grievances. They are least bothered about the customer satisfaction and only think of ways to extract more money from the customer. Nobody bothered to give me a callback to update me about the status. I had to keep following up with the customer care helpline as well as the Sony Service Center. I know few acquaintances who had similar experience with Service Center, Bhubaneswar.  4. My handset contained some photographs in the internal storage with my father who died this year and that was more valuable to me. I requested the service center to take the backup of my phone but they refused that it cannot be done as display is cracked .If I can do the data backup after exploring the internet for few hours then why can't the technicians employed by Sony do the same ??? Aren't they qualified enough???  5. While I handed over the handset to the service center there was a small area of damage to the display but when I received the handset from them the area of damage had increased significantly.. I have the photographs available with me..  6. I had heard that Sony Xperia Z1 is a flagship model and during service period the service center provides a temporary handset but in my case no temporary handset was also issued to me.  7. After sending an email to Sony Senior Management in India Sony Head Office Support team sent an email stating I have to pay 50% of MRP for refurbished handset without accessories and 80% of MRP (Rs 28,500/-) for fresh handset without accessories&#8230;.. Prices offered by local Sony Service Center and head office vary significantly which proves there is no baseline price&#8230; Whatever happens to your handset Sony people will simply ask you to pay another 20k -30k instead of replacing the faulty equipment&#8230;  It&#8217;s really frustrating as Sony Customer Service people are asking me to pay another 28k for the handset which is under warranty and the screen has also cracked on its own due to faulty design/bad quality equipment being used.  Trust me guys the service being offered by Samsung for Galaxy S4 which is a comparable model with Z1 is much better than Sony&#8230; Sony is having the worst after sales service&#8230; I would like to request everyone not to go by brand instead buy the products having better after sales service to make your life hassle free&#8230;&#8230;"], ["1.0", "How painful this can be", "krishnendu sarkar", "the product never reached me.

And I had brought the flagship phone on the day of its launch the Xolo q800 in the previous year march 2013. Now, recently from the past 2 months i have been facing issues with 4 phones which I had brought for my company that is a q700i , q800 and 2phones Q3000 model. Firstly Q700i, In this phone the issue stands is that the phone is having a heating up problem . The charger also gets highly heated up. The speaker is having a distorted noise problem.  Secondly, Q3000, In this model the charger stopped working in its 3rd month itself. When I have approached the service center they are worst bunch of service center people I have experienced in my life. They in no sense know the meaning of the term &#34;Service&#34;. They have made me feel that customer is a slave if you have brought this company's products. I gave my q3000 model charger to the service center people they have given me a q1010i charger after 10days of my continues followup.When I denied to accept it they said to trust them and they will give me my model charger in more 10-15days. Now, they are saying that submit the q1010i charger also and they will give me a charger of q3000 after more 15days as they cannot get my original charger from the company and if I leave this charger also with them then only they will give me that charger after 15 days. They will talk to the customer in the most abusive manner a person can and have asked me to whatever I can.  In Q700i I have given the phone to them for the repairing of the problem but they have taken the phone and will be giving after repairing after 2months only. How can a person using a smartphone in the company work without the phone for 2months. The phone was given to the person for its functionalities of using Emails, Camera , Google Drive, Company ERP software, location TRacking, watsapp,etc. the company should be providing a standby handset if the services cannot be met within 2-3days maximum.

I wanted a phone not so big and with plenty of battery life, great camera, call quality, offline maps, well integration of social network and yes good gaming experience. Some of these, i missed on ios and the battery thirsty android. So just gave a shot at Lumia 830 even thou i was familiar with the OS with my past experience with Lumia 800 2yrs back. Advantages: 1. 10mp Pureview OIS camera (way excellent than 8mp competitors) 2. Durable and slim design, aluminium frame with no coverage issues (see images) 3. Expandable 128GB slot excluding the 16GB inbuilt  (Nexus 5/4s 16gb is limited to 12.28GB) 4. 5'' Clear black IPS 720p display with oleo-phobic coating is easy to clean now. Gorilla 3 addition is great. 5. Great 2200mah battery with over 12hrs hardcore use and 25+hrs light use. (Nexus/4s/5s/5 all died within 8hrs limit!) 6. Good 1.2ghz quad core snapD 400 chip with adreno 305 gpu and adequate 1GB ram (8/10 gaming experience) 7. LTE support (Cat 4 speeds) 8. NFC, wireless charging and bluetooth 4.0  Disadvantages: 1. For the premium price paid you can get a 1080p display phone! 2. SnapDragon 400 is somewhat pricey for a phone for 25k! SnapDragon 800's are available for this price. 3. Nano sim slot placed between the battery waist! No hot swap here. (see images)  I am aware it is a flagship device and the last phone to bear the iconic \"Nokia\" badge but the premium price for a phone with mid-range chip is somewhat pricey. The same chip is found on Lumia 730 with a better Amoled display with slightly better display ppi. But missing premium option like even a camera key! Nexus 5, LG G2 and Z1 compact are other options with a higher 2.2ghz snapdragon 800 chip but not as good as Lumia 830 when it comes to the ratio between the enormous battery and snappy snapdragon 400 processor. My previous phone was a Nexus 5 which had a pretty good performance and eye popping screen with 445 ppi! But these plus points turned out to have a disappointing battery and camera quality (awful quality, my sisters Lumia 720 had an even better 6.7mp camera). Snapdragon 400 maybe too pricey for a 25k device but windows phone 8.1 doesn't need hi-fi specs to run the OS. Windows 7.8 even ran fine on single core 800ghz with 256mb ram device namely Lumia 510. But here you gt a quad-core chip (thou under-clocked at 1.2ghz) with adreno 305 gpu and a 1GB ram adequate to even fiddle while editing HD videos using Movie Creator app. Games like Modern Combat 4 and 5 never hung up, crashed or heated up my device. There is zero heating issue or hangups on my device. The 2200mah battery is spectacular. The micro sd slot is swap-able. Ending my review finally talking about the built quality. Its 10/10! Perfect, rigid and yes Nokia standards. The design resembles iphone similar network band gaps and yes the 930 itself. The rear camera and led are encircled by glass made material with is good. Even the buttons are metal made. I just hope the metal frame does't dent or fade off like on 5/5s! Hope this review was helpful.

Till now i have not used the original charger yet, wireless charging is way more convenient. Build quality looks absolutely amazing. Button on the side and the aluminum borders have a premium feel. Very good looking phone.  Cons: Black levels are not that deep from the screen. Design of the phones edges sometimes get a tad uncomfortable.

Windows Phone has matured enough to compete with other mainstream operating systems. I would venture so far as to say that it is better than them in some respects.  The Phone - The Nokia Lumia 830 is a beautiful piece of hardware. It is perfect for taking pictures and as usual, I was blown away by the battery life. With the advent of Gestures Beta, the phone has become my perfect everyday companion.  Apps - MixRadio is one application that sets Windows Phone apart from any other phone currently on the market. Almost every mainstream application has been redesigned with a Metro interface which makes the entire experience coherent and easy to navigate.  Gaming - I used the Lumia 830 mostly for games from the Asphalt series. Plays beautifully without any lag.  Screen/Display - The display has a 720p resolution but you won't notice any difference from a full HD display for everyday use. The 5&#34; screen is a little big for users coming from smaller screens and unwieldy for one hand use.  Support - Nokia Care is amazing as usual. I don't yet know how the takeover will affect these stores but support should be available for some time.  The Future - Free Windows 10 updates have been announced for all phones running Windows 8.1. Considering that Windows 10 seeks to unify Desktop, Mobile and Tablet form factors into a single OS/Store, it is definitely an exciting time to become a Windows Phone user if you aren't one already."], ["4.3", "I'm very pleased indeed and would recommend it to anyone wanting a ...", "Nic", "What a lovely phone this is.

Have been using the device for almost 24 hours now and the usage has been heavy. Here's what it think about the device:  WHAT IS GOOD: The screen is a delight to watch as the 5.5 inch panel powers up to vivid colors. The build quality is good and feels sturdy and due to tapered edges and reduced thickness, the device doesn't feel all that huge. The speakers were pleasantly loud and clear - didn't really expect such clarity. The stock Android 4.4.2 is easy to use with minimum frills. The IT Remote was easy to setup and worked effortlessly with my LG Smart TV, Airtel DTH and LG DVD player. The finger print scanner was another surprise and was fairly simple to setup. I'd however prefer the number lock. The battery life is fairly decent - started the day will foll charge at 4:00 AM and the usage has been fairly heavy throughout the day. 17 hours later, the batter was down to ~50%. Overall build quality, call quality, user interface, etc is all good.  WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER: The backlit capacitative keys were barely illuminated - for long I thought that there was no illumination. The camera interface seems difficult and very non-intuitive. The charging port and the cable provided dont seem to fit in too well at time. The Floating Task widget, bundled with the software seems distracting at times and I finally had to disable it. One last thing, I noticed a wierd thing with the Browser - When I click the link on a page like &#34;news.google.co.in&#34;, a new tab opens up but teh URL does not open.May need a few trials open the URL.

I bought it from a local store for around the same price(11k) Before going out to make my purchase,I had reviewed many other same ranged devices & had actually decided to buy Panasonic Eluga S or HTC Desire 620G as the second option. Comparing the specs on paper,Sony stood nowhere near both of these devices.I was almost sure about my purchase until I hit the shop and did a hands on review myself.I was astonished by the results. The resolution was way far better than the HTC Desire 620g The new curvy design the bulgy back cover made it a more attractive device. The 5mp camera proved to be much much better than any 8mp camera from HTC or Micromax(Even Panasonic) It could handle several multi-tasking windows without any lag while there was no such option available in HTC or Panasonic It had a record screen option where you could record the ongoing tasks with sound The apps with cameras were just amazing(Sound photographs,Wide Landscapes and much much more) Over all-It was just what i wanted Good Battery Back Up,Optimum SAR Value,Great Camera,Vivid Sound and Picture Quality and I bought it without any second thought. After 20 days of usage,Here's what I figured #Pros- * Good Battery life.Lasts over a day and half even with high internet usage * Battery Saver modes like Ultra Stamina Mode,Low Battery Mode work efffectively * Camera clicks great photographs under day light * Touch is responsive.Viewing angles are great * Auto Brightness feature adjusts quite well according to the surroundings * There's an LED Notification bar near the front camera(Blinks white for notifications,Green while charging and Red for Low battery) * Stunning Build Quality,You'll definitely feel good holding it #Cons: * Camera isn't that good in low light.Clicks average photographs. * Some inbuilt apps are of no use * Takes around 2 and half hours to charge considering the fact it has bigger battery than the same ranged devices.  Now,Over-all,Its a handy device and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone over Micromax,HTC or Samsung.Although the specs mentioned on the paper might put you in doubt about my review,But I'd say visit a local store,use it and see the difference yourself.

Publicity for this mobile is little bit less when compare to Samsung and Moto g, but LG's performance is great.  The biggest competitor for this mobile is Moto g and Samsung galaxy quattro.  All the three mobiles work on Quad core processors, 1Gb RAM  1. Samsung galaxy quattro's specifications are good but the performance is not upto the mark of other Samsung mobile.  2. Moto g is a great hype but there are lot of drawback in it.   1. Motorola doesnt have large number of service centers when compare to LG   2. Batteries are not removable so after 1 year if the battery is not performing good you need to curse yourself for buying it.   3. No expandable storage.   4. One the most important feature of mobile phone is to speak but most of the Moto g users say that there is the problem with microphone and speaker and the call quality is very low and you can never compromise with it.   5. After the Android 4.4.2 update camera is not working properly in Moto g and you it power OFF the device and power ON to make it working. 3. Moto g positives are Gorilla glass 3, HD screen, Higher ppi.  Why Lg L90 dual is a better than Moto g?   1. All the drawbacks of Moto g are recovered by LG and becomes as the strength to the L90 dual   2. This mobile can be used of everyday use- weight is less compared to G and Quattro, 0.2 big display than Moto g.   3. The biggest advantage is with the 4.7 inch display the entire length of the phone is only 13 cms so it easily fits into your pocket.   4. 8 MP camera and 2540 mah battery is better than other mobiles.   5. Android 4.4.2 is pre-installed, Quad core processor gives its best performance.   6. Knock code, Q slide apps, IR Remote are exciting and useful.  Cons:   1.

Weak Points :  1) No notification light. 2) No back-light for bottom bottons, but you get used to in a week once you develop muscle memory. 3) Slow battery charging : charging is capped at 1 amp.

Accidental presses are annoying but you get used to it. 5) No OTG support : you can't connect pen drive and other USB devices directly to phone. 6) Slippery design : prone to accidental drops from hands if not careful, because of the slippery back design. 7) Asphalt 8 the popular game doesn't work as of now."], ["5.0", "Nice class branded reliable phone...", "ATHUL THOMAS", "I bought this phone last week from amazon.First of all thank you amazon and Elephant Deals for delivering the phone safely within four days.

BATTERY-its really gud.almost 1.5 days on moderate usage.  SOFTWARE-its kitkat 4.4.2 & LG has put very awesome s/w features like multitasking-2-3 window open in 1 screen and all 3 can be used simultaneously. DOUBLE KNOCK TO off -ON screen. GUEST MODE-means u can show only those apps which u want when u give ur mob to others or kids. there is a CLIP TRAY where u can copy multiple words & paste it whenever u want & it doesnt get delete automatically-its gud. ----thr is SMART VIDEO-means if u watching MOVIE & sum1 calls u & u see somewhere else,the mob automatically detects tht u nt seeing on the screen & it PAUSE the VIDEO.  BODY-its simple plain body-not so great.also power button all plastic n very thin.also back cover n overall it doesnt match with the price. the body seems somewat cheap bt whn u get back cover, it looks gud.  CAMERA-back 8MP wid flash-its nt so gr8. the picture FADES & BLURR when u ZOOM-IN to the picture. LG must hv provided gud 8MP. belive me the picture quality seems gud bt the moment u ZOOM. it blurrs & edges fades. FRONT is VGA-0.3MP which is just useless & NO SELFIES-ITS TRUE. while recording VIDEO-u can record HD AND FULL HD & the quality is really great for VIDEOS bt quality of IMAGE WHILE ZOOM IN is not so great.  MEMORY-RAM is 1GB bt u get 380mb for usage & when u install apps FREE ram is 230-250mb. ROM-INTERNAL memory is 8GB bt u get 3.80GB & 1 imp thing-even when 350MB is free, it shows INSUFFICIENT MEMORY & u cant install apps-i guess this is kept for cache etc. but u can always get a SD-EXTERNAL memory card.  SIM-both SIM USE 3G SOUND-sound quality is awesome-thr is no problm. CALL QUALITY-- is gud, no problem IR BLASTER-- its useless as now a days we all hv DISH installed & we dont operate TV REMOTE, we just operate DISH REMOTE & LG L90 doesnt support DISH. bt u can always start-increase volume of TV-I hv used it on my SAMSUNG TV.  FINAL VERDICT--&#62; MOTO G2 is also gud choice bt it has non removable battery-so i doubt how to restart if it get HANG & power button dont work. LG L90 has all features of MOTO G2 bt lacks on CAMERA QUALITY little bit & BODY & half HD--means qHD DISPLAY.

In day light the pics are awesome with auto Intelligent mode & and even look professional with Background defocus mode.  When my mobile gets hot after playing games I even keep my mobile in Deep freezer for 10 mins :P  Surround sound + clear audio in walkman app, you really need good headphones for listening music.

Now, how can I recommend this phone, or, for that matter, any phone from sonymobile to any one in India?"], ["1.0", "Pathetic after sales support from Sony !!", "Ranjan Kumar Mohapatra", "When Sony Xperia Z1 released I was one of the first customers to buy the handset from Flipkart with lot of excitement...But trust me, I am experiencing pathetic customer service from the customer care and service center department.  Sony being a worldwide brand for electronics and home appliances, every customer expects to get prompt and appropriate service for their products, but in my case I failed to receive satisfactory service for a premium product like Xperia Z1&#8230;..  1. On 24th December when I woke up in the morning I saw my Xperia Z1 display having a crack from inside the cabinet.. There was no damage on the external glass but however, the display had cracked from inside.. A single scratch cannot be seen from the external where the display has cracked&#8230;.  2. In my case the local service center people are asking me to pay 18,000+ rupees to replace my handset completely instead of replacing the display although my handset is under warranty and the display had also cracked on it's own from inside. There is no sign of external damage on the screen.  3. Sony Customer Care executives and Sony Service Center are not well trained and they do not understand customer grievances. They are least bothered about the customer satisfaction and only think of ways to extract more money from the customer. Nobody bothered to give me a callback to update me about the status. I had to keep following up with the customer care helpline as well as the Sony Service Center. I know few acquaintances who had similar experience with Service Center, Bhubaneswar.  4. My handset contained some photographs in the internal storage with my father who died this year and that was more valuable to me. I requested the service center to take the backup of my phone but they refused that it cannot be done as display is cracked .If I can do the data backup after exploring the internet for few hours then why can't the technicians employed by Sony do the same ??? Aren't they qualified enough???  5. While I handed over the handset to the service center there was a small area of damage to the display but when I received the handset from them the area of damage had increased significantly.. I have the photographs available with me..  6. I had heard that Sony Xperia Z1 is a flagship model and during service period the service center provides a temporary handset but in my case no temporary handset was also issued to me.  7. After sending an email to Sony Senior Management in India Sony Head Office Support team sent an email stating I have to pay 50% of MRP for refurbished handset without accessories and 80% of MRP (Rs 28,500/-) for fresh handset without accessories&#8230;.. Prices offered by local Sony Service Center and head office vary significantly which proves there is no baseline price&#8230; Whatever happens to your handset Sony people will simply ask you to pay another 20k -30k instead of replacing the faulty equipment&#8230;  It&#8217;s really frustrating as Sony Customer Service people are asking me to pay another 28k for the handset which is under warranty and the screen has also cracked on its own due to faulty design/bad quality equipment being used.  Trust me guys the service being offered by Samsung for Galaxy S4 which is a comparable model with Z1 is much better than Sony&#8230; Sony is having the worst after sales service&#8230; I would like to request everyone not to go by brand instead buy the products having better after sales service to make your life hassle free&#8230;&#8230;"], ["5.0", "Happy with my new Z1", "Kaushik Mitter", "Excellent phone.

{"url": "http://www.amazon.in/Sony-Xperia-Z3-Compact-Black/dp/B00NPWQ932", "reviews": [["4.4", "Good phone, could have been great.", "Farhad Tarapore", "Have been using this phone since a month now. Here is what I have experienced.  1) Size: It's the perfect size for a phone. Prior to this, I had a Lumia 1520 which was too cumbersome to handle.  2) Display: It is good, clear and sharp. However one thing is that the auto-brightness does not work as I expected. I have to manually adjust the brightness in sunlight and turn it down indoors  3) Speakers: Not so loud. The back of the phone vibrates at full volume when playing Youtube videos. Setting the equalizer to full (all 5 sliders to max position) does help a little with the loudness Also the speaker is located at the front of the phone, so if the phone is in the pocket, it is not as loud as a phone that would have speakers at the bottom of the phone or some place where they don't get muffled.  4) Camera: Camera is really good. Even in low light. I use the default Sony camera app and I have found no reason to complain. Manual settings are cumbersome and deeply nested.  5) Battery life: Superb. Lasts me over two days with moderate to heavy usage. 3G always on, location/Wif-fi etc. when needed.  6) Usability: a) Copy paste is an issue - I recently found out that one needs to double tap the text in a text box to be able to select and copy it. Phone numbers cannot be copied from the call log - one has to edit the phone number and then long press it in the text box to copy it. Quite a bad experience.  b) Default Sony lock screen gets unlocked if you swipe in any direction. That, along with the easy depressability of the power button means, it can easily unlock itself in your pocket and you won't know what has happened. To solve this, either you can use a PIN or Pattern unlock with default screen. I use Locker Master 3rd party lock screen which has a swipe to unlock. Only left to right swipe will unlock it.  c) Charging the phone requires you to open the flap that covers the USB port. That cover is quite flimsy, so I bought a Magnetic charging cable. But that is not a very strong magnetic connection so unless you keep the phone flat on a table, it will keep disconnecting.  d) Playing music through car audio: NOT possible with USB connection unless you have the music on your SD card ( I don't have an SD card for this phone yet). Work around is you can use an RCA to RCA cable and plug one end into your phone's headphone jack and the other into your car stereo's AUX port.  e) USB mass storage only works with SD card. It won't expose the underlying file system and so you cannot just copy documents, mp3s, etc. like we used to be able to earlier.  f) Volume cannot be changed when screen is locked. This may seem like a small thing, but it's immensely useful. Doesn't work here.  g) Music widget does not show up when playing music in Walkman app. You have to drag the notification bar to see the music app or go to the app itself. Cannot change tracks from lock screen. Tried with default lock screen as well as Locker Master.  h) Reject with message: When the phone rings, the screen comes on and there is an option to &#34;reject with message&#34; that can be activated by swiping from bottom to up. This can accidentally happen when taking the phone out of the pocket. It's more of an annoyance and again, shows a lack of attention to details and usability while designing the phone app.  7. Durability: I have purchased a back case for this phone to protect it from scratches and drops. Phone seems sturdy enough and so far, no issues."], ["5.0", "They dont make it like this anymore.", "Shyam krishna", "Pros Snappy perfomance, great battery life, above average camera, Airtel 4G support, support for Lossless Audio Format (FLAC) out of the box, waterproofing (only in clean water not sea or even pool with chlorine) lets you answer a call while cooking and even wash it under tap water in case of any dirt or stain on the surface. If you were in love with the dimensions of Samsung Galaxy S2 as compared to the 5+ inch phablet monsters, then this is the perfect upgrade. Now with the lollipop update which rolled out in the 2nd week of April even in India , the deal just got sweeter. The battery can last for 2 days with wifi and bluetooth on and moderate usage, and definitely for more than a day with heavy usage as long as you do not spend half a day on maps with GPS enabled. It is truly a relief to know that there is no more hunting for power sockets as soon as the sun sets. Cons The front and back is glass which makes it slippery beyond your imagination. I had kept the phone on a wooden surface with around 3degree tilt and the next thing I hear is the sound of the phone falling on the floor after sliding off the surface. Thank God it only left a very minor scratch on the body. Speaking on the phone while using your ear and shoulder as support would only be possible after putting on a separate case. The charging point under the nylon flap/plug(for water proofing) is an inconvenience as well as prone to damage. Hence purchasing a magnetic charging cable also would be highly recommended."], ["4.0", "Compact beast", "Avinash Kumar", "I have been using this phone since several months. The phone is very easy on hands and the performance is also near to top notch. There are minor lags in UI sometimes, the dialer is slow, rest every thing is good. I find the flip to bring out the charging port irritating but as the phone is waterproof so no complains. I dont understand why the auto mode in camera only supports 8mp, though in manual mode 20mp is there but not every person is pro at using manual mode. Overall camera is good, low light photography is also fine. Battery easly lasts for a day with extensive uses. With android 4.4.4, apps cant be transfered to sdcard, even apps' (whatsapp) multimedia contants cant be transfer to sdcard by default. I guess might lollipop update this might be solved but haven't got the update yet. Call quality is decent, sometime there issues but that might be due to service provider.

Within four months its mic stopped functioning. - I sent it for service and for a long time it was kept on under repair status. - After 15 days of period which they commit as a maximum time to resolve it, they were not able to repair and called me and offered me another new mobile whose configuration was too low compared to the one I had. I strongly denied the offer and insisted to have my old mobile back. - After too many follow up emails and phone calls, I got a call from one of the manager (Mr. J) from XOLO's Noida service center and he sounded very positive and informed that he will personally take care of all the pains and resolve my queries. (Not naming that guy and not putting his personal number as after all he is also a professional) - As the mobile was not repaired in the time he committed, I called him again and he said he will check the status and get back. - Later on he called that they are not having the hardware and will be sending a BRAND NEW phone of the same model and he also dispatched the mobile on next day. - On receiving the mobile while started in the service station itself, I was shocked to see 2 PIRATED MOVIES copied into a so called brand new phone. Someone's personal message of IDEA which I never use as a SIM. - On usig it further I also found that the camera's quality was pathetic and also the phone heated too quickly. On top of that there was a permenant black spot on the screen. - I still believed that Mr. J is a good guy and called him and very positively he said that you send back me the phone and I will take care that you do not face any problems. He was also kind enough to understand my personal urgency to have a smart phone and said that once your urgency is over, you can send me and I will take care of everything. - I sent the BRAND NEW SECOND HANDED Mobile for service again with a letter to Mr J describing all the problems and also phoned hime with details of work order number (i.e. 510004166126) and again received a very positive response - After a long waiting period, no response and on calling I received that they won't be able to replace the mobile this time but he has instructed to the team to replace as many parts as possible and do regirous quality check - And on all subsequent calls they were killing the time with the reasons like unavailability of the time was always something which is shared. - When I talked to him last time, he informed that he will be dispatching it soon, when I asked that all the points in my letter have been taken care or not then he asked me for a copy of the letter again. And on receiving it, NO RESPONSE again and there has been 4 days to it. - Luckily I get him on call again after too many unsuccssful attempts (by phone, email, SMS) and he informed that as they have received the letter yesterday only, they are now checking against it. :(. Boss this information was there on your WO. Also a letter was sent with this and also it was told to you number of times over the call, but still you want me to here this piece of ****. - Now that guy does not receive my phone calls most of the time and when I am lucky enough to get him on the call, he keeps telling the stories that it will be dispatched today but again that has never happened.

Im just loving it......it is simply the best phone @ this price range....!! working smoothly...gud camera quality...gud battery backup.....no heating problem as somebody complaintd... and  im completely happy with the service of amazon....."], ["5.0", "Canvas Nitro ..Value for Money", "mac", "Edit : One seller is selling this for 16K. The real price of this phone is around 12K.  First of all, i wanna thank Xiaomi, only because of their agressive pricing, we in India now can have great spec'ed devices from Micromax,Xolo etc for an affordable price. Nitro A310 is without any doubt,best you can get for the price as of this writing.  Lets talk about the device now. Is it worth it?  Display and Build quality 5 inch HD (720P) display. I am actually not disappointed for this not having a 1080P screen.Human eye can't see anything higher than 300PPI and more pixels means more Battery the display consumes. 5 inch 720P is the ideal combination in my opinion. Oleophobic Coating/ Anti-finger Print coating is really a nice thing to have.It has a leather back panel offering better grip.  Processor and Ram This is powered by a Mediatek Octacore chipset (MT6592w clocked at 1.7Ghz) and has a quadcore Mali 450 MP4 GPU clocked at 700 Mhz. The performance of this combination is really great and you would hardly find any issues during playing HD games and all. 2GB ram ensures good multitasking.  Battery One of the mistakes many Indian OEMs did with their octacore phones is packing them with a small battery. Micromax on the other hand decided to pack this with a larger 2500mAh battery to ensure you wont run out of battery before the day ends.  Camera : 13MP 2.2 Aperture Sony Sensor, Rear Camera and a 5MP 2.4 Aperture BSI Front Camera. This is the same combination you can see in Xolo 8x-1100 and looking at the specs,they both have the same front and back camera sensors. Overall performance of the camera is sure gonna be good.Expect noise to creep in when the light drops. A 2.4 aperture front camera,gets in more light to get better selfies.  Software This is running Android 4.4 Kitkat and i hope Micromax will care to update this with Android L when it gets official. Since there is no official announcement on this, i suspect this to take time,maybe 3-4 months after Android L source code is fully out. Micromax is boasting a lot of custom added software features to the stock Android Kitkat,you can see the details on that on their official website.Strangely,Canvas Nitro doesn't support OTG,so you can't plug in your pendrives.  Verdict Overall Canvas Nitro is really a great device for the price.Value for money.There are some other octacore devices at this price range,but they are powered by a MT6592m processor clocked at 1.4Ghz and most have a 2000mAh battery. The obvious direct contenders are the New Moto G second gen and Xiaomi Mi3.Moto G has some cool software features and im pretty sure it will get software updates very fast compared to Micromax or any other OEMs in India. Android L update is guaranteed too,but whether canvas nitro will get L update remains to be seen.If you want a phone with better Specs like Gorilla glass,Dual speakers etc,Xolo 8x1100 is also there,but only comes with a 2100mAh Battery.Overall Canvas Nitro,spec-wise, is a real value for money device.  Edit: Now you have some other devices with same 1.7Ghz Octacore available for similar prices Eg Karbonn Octane Plus"], ["4.0", "Nice phone for the budget", "DHITHIN", "Micromax Canvas Nitro A310 - Total value for money... But with the following exceptions - 1) Speaker Sound Quality is just average.. 2) RAM is preloaded with many poor and unuseful apps. 3)Camera: Good in daylight but decent in low light, much better than what i expected,front camera is brilliant for selfies- Wide angles photos can be captured 4)Mainly problem is battery.From 100% to 70% mobile will works fine,after 70% battery drains very very very fast and it goes to 6%. 5)Default storage option given in settings does not work; Can't install / Move apps in SD card 6)If you use rear 13MP camera for while also it becomes heat. 7)Build quality- phones back panel is an eye popper. Leather finish is best, very light in weight 8)quick look feature is nice as htc link feed  Overall its a pretty good phone!"], ["5.0", "Micromax Canvas Nitro A310  with very good battery backup", "Prathuin C.K", "I had purchased Micromax Nitro from Amazon for Rs 10970/- .Micromax nitro seems to be rebranded version of coolpad  halo F1 phone which is available in China. I am using MMX nitro for last 3 months and it is really good in terms of battery backup , performance and display. Micromax after sales service had improved much. I had past experience with my Micromax Unite 2 which had got complaint with back light LED ,got repaired  within 4 days from MMX service center at Kannur  it would be better if MMX pushed update to bring USB OTG support. OTG support can&#8217;t be fixed by using apps like OTG helper,OTG checker,OTG diagonistics,Nexus media importer etc etc. so better wait for update.Please all mail this basic need to Micromax,Hope Micromax will take care of this in upcoming Android L update.(Note :- Asus had provided update to make OTG support on its device).  I have rooted my mmx nitro using Kingo root software.(It is very easy to root and uroot using kingo root app)..  Battery backup seems to be too good. More than 2500 mah battery i think mmx had done some tweaks to improve battery performance(16 hours of battery backup as per NDTV video Loop test).Micromax nitro had got Li Polymer battery which is not mentioned in many review sites. Li - Polymer is always better than Li Ion batteries. For all those who are facing the fast battery drain after and around 70% should do a software update(Go to settings-About phone-software update). Micromax has already fixed the Battery calibration issue.  Install SDfix app and Link2SD card app. Then you will be able to convert the System apps to User app by using Link2SD card app,It thus helps to uninstall true caller and other unwanted boalwares.(Phone should be rooted).SDfix app help to delete/move/modify files within the third-party app like MX player,File manager etc.  Update clean master app if any one are facing restarting problem  Nitro users please dont wait for Android L update,root your phone using King root app and install the following applications  1 Greenify app (Will give great backup by hibernating apps when not in use,Note i have installed more than 80 apps in my phone still i have 950 MB free this is only due to this app)  2. Xposed frame work and Gravity Box ( Can customize Quick setting (Drop down from the top) to your wish, Can bring torch, 2G/3G mode etc etc in the quick settings and much more options...Can make transparent drop down drawer,Can rearrange the tiles ect..  You can do much more than what Ardroid L offers by just installing the above apps on your stock Android 4.4.2 ROM...No need of going for custom ROMS...  Those who are complaining about battery back must read NDTV,Gogi Rana, Digit battery review for Nitro.... battery back up: if you use for only calls then it's giving 2 days backup. if i use only watsapp, then its giving more than 1 day, if i use watsapp and fb messenger, it gives for almost 1 day. if i use browsing, then it will give for only halfday.  No use of Anti Fingerprint coating since we use screen guard over it.I came to know from some other website that there is some sort of screen protection other than Gorilla Glass for this set,So no worries.  Rear Camera quality is good, though low light shots are not that great. Use 360 camera to capture better pics.... Front camera is excellent. Gesture support for camera -Can capture pics very fast and smart using V gesture(Not available in high end devices like Xiaomi Mi3,Lumia 730 etc)  Video pause if you look away from the screen while watching videos. Has almost pure stock Android so great options for customization. Can take 360 degree view of an Object using Multi angle shoot option inbuilt in stock camera app.  Overall nice phone with Very good battery backup."], ["4.0", "a good phone. da only prob is being micromax its ...", "Sudhanshu Shekher", "a good phone. da only prob is being micromax its hardware is not as good as it says such as 13 mp is no better than 8 mp and da rest is da same. bt all in all not a bad deal"], ["3.0", "Not Worth This Price.", "Aditya Kumar Gupta", "Its ok product, you can't expect superb quality at this price, but (Xiaomi Mi3 is exception).

It has almost met all the expectation of mine. Also, I got this mobile little bit cheaper @Rs 10000 due to the diwali deals. Here are the few pros and cons listed out as experienced by me:- Pros- 1) Octacore and 2gb ram, so obviously, no lagging while playing hd videos or playing high-end games like asphalt 8 adrealine,real racing,etc. 2) 16GB Internal memory meaning you don't have to worry about installing too many applications. 3) Stylish and sleek design with matte-finish back cover leaving other people jealous. 4) Good speakers= good music experience. Also, the earphones coming along with it, had the terrific music quality leaving me over whelmed.  Cons- 1) NO moving of apps from internal memory-to-external sd card. But, 16 GB of internal memory and the option of storing apps additional info on external card is enough to cover it. 2) Also, battery is not properly calibrated,i.e., battery decreases from 100% to 80%-90% in one day and suddenly it decreases to 10% the next day. Solutions are given on the net to resolve this issue.  Due to above two cons, I missed out on 5 stars. But, if you don't find this two cons as a major issue, then go ahead and buy it without giving it any second thought."]], "title": "Micromax Canvas Nitro A310 (Blue)"}

{"url": "http://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-S5-Shimmery-White/dp/B00JB6RXBI", "reviews": [["3.9", "Samsung Galaxy S5 ..The 'Next Big thing' is here..", "mac", "First of all, Samsung Galaxy S5, successor to hugely popular Galaxy S4 comes in two versions. One powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset and the other powered by Adonis Prime2 (Quad 1.9GHz + Quad 1.3GHz) of which, later version is available in India. If you have doubts check samsung india galaxy s5 page for full specs.  Both are very powerful chipsets and the benchmarks scores are almost identical. This has 2GB of ram,unlike the Note 3 released earlier which had 3GB of ram. Throw anything at it,whether it be a full HD video or a high end game,everything runs on this device without any issues. One thing which is missing in the version available in India is LTE support. S5 available in India supports HSPA+ 42.2Mbps speeds.  ##  Display and Build Quality The display quality is much better than its predecessor Galaxy S4's display, and there is a small increase in size (5.1 inches from 5 Inches on S4 ). Everything looks sharp and vivid on S5's Super Amoled screen and is said to be one of the best displays available in the market.  The back of the device is now a 'leathery' plastic giving it a less glossy appearance but giving it a better feel when holding. One important feature S5 boasts is that this has an IP67 certification which means that it&#8217;s water and dust resistant. Overall the looks of the device resembles older phones in the Samsung Galaxy line up. I think its high time for Samsung to improve the looks of their Galaxy Flagship devices. Look at HTC One M8 for instance,the build quality is top notch and Samsung is nowhere near that type of attractive looks and the built quality.  ## Camera Main(Rear) : 16MP (1/2.6&#8221;, Phase Detection AF) Sub (Front) : 2.0MP (1920 x 1080, Wide-angle lens ) The camera on the S5 is ,as you can expect is better than the one seen on S4,and offer common software features like HDR (Rich tone), Selective Focus, Virtual Tour Shot. 4K video recording is also supported (5 mins limitation is there ). One other feature Samsung boasts about the camera is the improved,faster auto focus capabilities. S5's camera is without any doubt,one of the best you can get now in an Android smartphone,but when comparing to S4,the difference in quality is not that huge. Low light performance is also not that good.  ## Software This is running the latest version of the Touchwiz UI on top of Android 4.4 Kitkat. As you can expect, the UI and the apps operation are very fast with almost no lags. Since this is a flagship device,this is eligible to get future Android version updates too. It has features like Fingerprint unlocking,Heart rate monitor etc.  ## Some Highlights and Misc Features The home button now includes a capacitive fingerprint sensor. A heart rate monitor next to the LED flash. Sensors : Accelerometer, Gyro, Proximity, Compass, Barometer, Hall, RGB ambient light, Gesture, Fingerprint, Heart Rate Sensor Connectivity : USB3.0, BlueTooth 4.0 Storage : 16GB User Memory + microSD slot (up to 128GB) . Emergency Mode, Ultra Power Saving Mode, S Health, Quick Connect, Private Mode, Kids Mode.  ## Battery 2800mAh one is good enough to get you through one whole day of moderate usage.Ultra Power Saving Mode turns the screen into gray scale,with limited apps,which helps to get more juice out and can last longer.  ** Verdict - Should you upgrade from Galaxy S4 ? ** Overall a great device,coming with the latest,and the fastest available processors and many cool software additions. As you can expect, the price of the device is at the high end of the spectrum,and in my opinion is overpriced. If you are an S4 user,i think this is not a very great upgrade in terms of performance and software features. Many of the software features and the new touchwiz is gonna land on S4 eventually anyway. For an S3 user,the look,the performance and the camera are surely gonna be very refreshing and the overall experience would be far much enjoyable. If you have enough money, and for some reason don't like similarly priced newer HTC One M8 or Xperia Z2,look no where else.

We are supposed to pay more for than US & other countries & yet get a comparatively inferior version.  Like many previous reviews have pointed out this phone has Samsung Proprietary Exynos Octa processor, which is slower than Quad Core Snapdragon 801 in US, heats up pretty quickly, eats too much battery, does not support LTE, & worst of all there is no third party developer support because Samsung is too lazy to provide documentation & driver binaries for developers.  Build quality is same old plastic Samsung is known for, plus they have added flaps to make it waterproof but it is still not true waterproof phone like Sony Xperia Z, it can be called spill proof phone.  Camera has been improved a bit but no OIS like many other phones or any innovation like HTC One M8 with selective focus with dual camera lenses.  Size keeps getting bigger & bigger, wonder when this trend of making bigger phones with so high pixel density will stop.  They have added Fingerprint scanner which is too a gimmick rather than necessity to justify this price tag, also there is heart-rate monitor, don't who would be interested in this.  Their TouchWiz has been bloated for years & it surprises me with every generation they somehow manage to find even more bloat to add to already bloated OS. Anyone remember Magazine UI in latest Note series that even managed to lag on Snapdragons even Google was upset with that UI.  They have added NSA sponsored Samsung Knox, which may be useful for &#62;1% of users but is irritating for rest of the 99% of users.

Viewing angles are good.  2) This is powered by a MTK 6582M Quad-core 1.3GHz Processor which performs on par with the popular Mtk6589 processor. The GPU on board is a Mali-400 MP. It performs better than the usual GPU, PowerVR SGX 544MP, seen in mtk6589 devices like Micromax Turbo,Xolo 3000 etc.Gaming performance is great for the price.  (Note : GSMArena lists this has a PowerVR SGX 544MP GPU which is an error, gfxbenchmark website clearly shows it has a Mali-400 MP )  3) 1 GB Ram, which has now become a standard in 10K+ devices, allows lag free multitasking.  4) Jellybean 4.2.2 - Not the latest,but still new and better than 4.1 Jellybean. Im not sure whether this device will ever get updates to 4.3 or 4.4. No word from lenovo yet. Like any other Lenovo device,this too has a modified custom ui,so not a stock android experience.  5) Battery - Li-Po 2250 mAh battery which is good. You can get around 2 days of average use with low brightness settings.  6) Camera - 5 MP Rear and VGA Front Cam. Photo quality is not good.  7) Storage -  You CANNOT move or install apps to the sdcard,so you are stuck with around 2 GB of internal memory for apps and games installation,which is not enough if you plan to install a lot of games.

The UI is stock Android,which makes it buttery smooth to navigate. 1GB Ram ensures good multitasking. Overall performance is great.

The box seal was broken and the phone inside was hit just below the hole. Luckily it was the screen guard which protected the screen from getting damaged. It is clear that the seller was aware of the issue, but packed it and sent to me, as outer packing was not damaged.  Phone camera is not working perfectly. It is getting blurry images and videos with hazy lines sometimes.  Talking about the phone... It is awesome product with super value for money. Performance, looks, battery backup, usability, every thing is as mentioned and can beat almost all top phones in the market in performance.  I will suggest to avoid this seller, try somewhere else if planning for this phone. I have been fooled, lets see what is amazon upto for this issue. I will let everyone updated.  Updating my review....  Got problem of touch screen after two month of use. Upper half touch screen stopped working. So, went to Lenovo service centre on 28/03/14. they kept the phone and returned back to me on 17/04/14 with DOA (Replacement Certificate). I asked them to make the replacement. But I got shocked with their reply... they said, Since I purchased the phone through online shopping site, they wont replace the phone. I have DOA and the phone sealed in its box, was suggested to courier it to the seller so I did it. Called the seller for the status after a week and got a reply that since I have made online purchase and the seller is far from me, it will take time. Maybe 15 days to a month.  Friends, I did this shopping since there was 10% cash back and was a good offer. But what I got out of it, A defective phone with very poor service for online buyers. Paid shipping charge to amazon, then for replacement and don't know if there is some more left. Secondly, used the phone for less than two month and the phone is roaming from me to service centre and then to the seller and don't know where is it now for more than a month. I don't know when will the phone arrive to me.  Lesson is that, I will never do the same thing again and will ask every one to avoid it. One can go to any service centre of any brand and enquire for the service and DOA cases for online purchased items. Don't go after attractive price advertisements or other things. There will be no one to support after fooling you."], ["5.0", "The Red beauty !!!", "Harry LeFou \"Mr.Fou\"", "It's been a week since I started using this mobile.  It took me close to two months, before I narrowed down to this model & I am happy to have purchased it.  My budget was upto 20k and I had Samsung, Micromax, Nokia & even Nexus 4 in mind (though it costs a few extra 4k). Still, somehow I went with this model, for the following reasons: cool looks, good configuration for this cost, 12 mp camera & at a comparatively lower price.  Many of my friends told not to go for it, as Lenovo is very new to the (mobile phone) market. Still, I had trust in IBM & went for it. So far looks good and with it's sleek design, doesn't feel like carrying a big mobile of 4.7 inches. Camera clarity is really good & even in night time, with LED flash, the quality of photos looks cool. The mobile is loaded with inbuild apps (of course other too do come), 8gb internal memoery, with an option to expand upto 32 gb with the sd card. A very responsive touch & it doesn't get hanged.  The only thing I couldn't feel, is the fact that the battery life doesn't last beyond a day (no complaints, but expected to last a bit longer, as it was comparatively better than other models in at least paper).

There are many useful apps pre installed but still around 500 mb of ram is free , 8 GB of internal storage as given in the specification. 7. Battery life is more than satisfactory, lenovo Power management application is there to manage the battery uses. 8. GUI is awesome, gives you lots of options for customization.  Cons: 1.

Been using it for over a month and have faced no issues whatsoever.  The only thing that Amazon can do to improve phone devices is start providing mobiles with a screen guard. A screen guard is a must for all touch screen mobiles, and the customers have to order them separately, or go to a shop to get it fitted ( to ensure no bubbles form, which is likely when the customer herself does it).

{"url": "http://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Quattro-GT-I8552-Ceramic/dp/B00CTKUV4Y", "reviews": [["3.9", "Just an average phone. Not worth the money.", "mac", "Grand Quattro is a 'budget' device from Samsung,with low end specs when comparing to other devices at this price range. Is it worth buying? Lets analyse.  Display  : 4.7 inches, Resolution - 480 x 800 pixels (~199 ppi pixel density) .  Other devices at this price ships with 300+ PPI with a better 720P/1080P resolution  Processor & Ram : Quadcore ,Qualcomm MSM8625Q Snapdragon 200 - yes its Qualcomm,but this is an entry level processor powered by less powerful A5 cores instead of better A7 cores seen in Mediatek devices. Grand Quattro has 1 GB of Ram. Micromax Canvas Turbo,priced lesser than this now,has 2GB of ram. Since the processor is no powerhouse,you may experience occasional lags often.  Camera : Just average.Outdoor pics in good light are OK,but nothing to excited about. You can record 720P video with this but only 15fps which is not good.  Battery : Li-Ion 2000 mAh battery can last 1 day of moderate use. Cheaper Xolo Q700 packs a bigger battery is to be noted.  Some Notable Cons 1) Running Old Android version - 4.1 Jellybean 2) No light sensor - so no Auto Brightness. 3) Very bad screen resolution - 480 x 800 pixels on a 4.7 inch screen is ugly.  Verdict Overall its a good branded 'budget' device suitable for basic usage. This is not at all suitable for high end gaming and all. Buy this only if you want a branded device. If you really want a branded device at this price,then buy Moto G instead of this as it packs far better overall specs and performance. There are also plenty of far better performing devices with far better specs available from Xolo,Micromax,Gionee etc at the price range. So consider those before paying for this overly priced device."], ["3.0", "dont take it", "vamshi", "samsung did not release an update for its android version. its still 4.1.2  where as all other phones in this range are having 4.2.2 or more"], ["4.0", "Samsung Quattro = High Performance + Very Good Value-for-Money", "Rakesh Malhotra", "I am using the Samsung Quattro GT-i8552 Mobile for over 6 months now. The Samsung Quattro is a High Performance Mobile which delivers Very Good Value-for-Money spent. Six months ago I would have written 'excellent value-for-money spent' but thanks to new launches and competition, today it has a worthy competitor in the \"Xperia C\" Mobile from SONY, albeit at a slightly higher price.  An indicator of Samsung Quattro's High Performance + VFM proposition is that, perhaps it is the only mobile phone in the market which has not seen a price drop during the last 6 months. This phone has not been widely advertised by Samsung as it competes with many of its own models primarily the Galaxy Grand i9082. Originally intended to be a VFM Large Screen + High Performance Samsung Product to compete with domestic brands like Micromax, Karbonn, Xolo and others, it has already won many Happy Customers.  For the first time user of a 4+ inch size phone, this phone might just be the most comfortable phone to hold and use in comparison with the bulky 5.3+ inch Phablets available in the market. The Samsung Quattro can also be carried conveniently in a Shirt's Top Pocket. I have used and tested this phone as a Single SIM phone and not as a Dual SIM phone. It has a Good Touch Screen. The phone does not slow down while running multiple popular applications (with a few running in the background). Quattro's Battery Backup is also better than many other Android Phones which I have used.  It also has a few Negatives viz.  1. It CANNOT playback Full HD Videos (HD Videos are of Better Quality, for e.g. Music Videos in Full HD, specially when viewed on larger Displays like TVs, PC Monitors, etc.) 2. In spite of being equipped with a 5MP Camera, its Still Pictures come out in AVERAGE Quality. 3. It DOES NOT support Video Recording in HD/Full HD [1920*1080p] and can record only in VGA [640x480p]. (HD Videos are of Better Quality, specially when viewed on larger Displays like TVs, PC Monitors, etc.) 4. WVGA 480*800 Display. (Quattro's Display is Sharper than the Display of the Samsung Grand Duos which has the same resolution, due to its slightly smaller Display Size, but is inferior than the Crisper qHD (540*960) Display of the Sony Xperia C).  If your Budget is 15K-16K and you are OK with the aforesaid limitations, go for the Quattro. If you can stretch your budget to 18K-19K consider the Sony Xperia C Mobile which does not have the aforesaid negatives but has only 4GB Internal Storage as against 8GB Internal Storage in the Quattro. I have also reviewed the Xperia C Mobile on the Amazon India website.

Sometimes the mobile is not charged properly. Many friends of mine also faced the similar problem. I have shown my mobile to the Samsung service centre,  they told me that the charger was defective, and suggested to buy a new charger which costs rs1200. (what a business) 4&#62; the price that Samsung charges for these models is very high as compared to other company mobiles which have more features at low cost.

Is it worth buying? Lets analyse.  Display  : 4.7 inches, Resolution - 480 x 800 pixels (~199 ppi pixel density) .  Other devices at this price ships with 300+ PPI with a better 720P/1080P resolution  Processor & Ram : Quadcore ,Qualcomm MSM8625Q Snapdragon 200 - yes its Qualcomm,but this is an entry level processor powered by less powerful A5 cores instead of better A7 cores seen in Mediatek devices. Grand Quattro has 1 GB of Ram. Micromax Canvas Turbo,priced lesser than this now,has 2GB of ram. Since the processor is no powerhouse,you may experience occasional lags often.  Camera : Just average.Outdoor pics in good light are OK,but nothing to excited about. You can record 720P video with this but only 15fps which is not good.  Battery : Li-Ion 2000 mAh battery can last 1 day of moderate use. Cheaper Xolo Q700 packs a bigger battery is to be noted.  Some Notable Cons 1) Running Old Android version - 4.1 Jellybean 2) No light sensor - so no Auto Brightness. 3) Very bad screen resolution - 480 x 800 pixels on a 4.7 inch screen is ugly.  Verdict Overall its a good branded 'budget' device suitable for basic usage. This is not at all suitable for high end gaming and all. Buy this only if you want a branded device. If you really want a value for money,branded device at this price,then buy Moto G instead of this as it packs far better overall specs and performance. There are also plenty of far better performing devices with far better specs available from Xolo,Micromax,Gionee etc at the price range.

So here the question comes, which on is more powerful?  Galaxy S5 Exynos beats Snapdragon 801  Previously also Samsung launched its flagship Galaxy S4 in two main variants &#8211; 1. GT-I9500 (Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU &#8211; Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 and quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7 GPU &#8211; PowerVR SGX 544MP3) 2. GT-I9505 (quad core Snapdragon 600, LTE) Though there was also a Korean Octa Core version of Galaxy S4 (SHV-E300K/S/L (Korean; Exynos 5 Octa core, LTE) And later Samsung came up with Galaxy S4 GT-I9506 (quad core Snapdragon 800, LTE-A), but if you consider main two version of Galaxy S4, according to different benchmark tests GT-I9505 (Snapdragon 600) clearly beats its Octa-Core variant GT-I9500. HMP technology of Exynos 5422 &#8211; The Game Changer  But scenario is different in case of Galaxy S5. AnTuTu showed Galaxy S5 octa-core is more powerful than the Snapdragon variant. In the benchmark test Galaxy S5 Snapdragon 801 variant scored 36,000 points and Exynos 5422 version beat it, scoring 38,500 points. The reason behind this 2.5K lead is HMP or Heterogeneous Multi Processing of Exynos 5422 chip.  The Exynos 5410 processor of the Galaxy S4 octa core is not able to turn his eight cores simultaneously for reasons of safety. It can only use its four 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 cores or four 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7 cores at a time, according to the workload. But the HMP technology allows Galaxy S5 Exynos 5422 to run all the eight cores of processor simultaneously during high utilization. Thus (4\u00d72.1 + 4\u00d71.5 GHz) Exynos 5422 Galaxy S5 has taken a lead over (4\u00d72.5 GHz) Snapdragon Galaxy S5, especially in the CPU department.  Galaxy S5 Snapdragon 801 vs Galaxy S5 Exynos 5422 Octa Core Some more advantages of Galaxy S5 Exynos 5422 Octa Core over Galaxy S5 Snapdragon 801  1. Galaxy S5 Exynos has 133 MHz higher ram speed than the Snapdragon variant(800 MHz vs 933 MHz). 2. Exynos powered Galaxy S5 is more power efficient, as during low work load it can only use its Little cores to save battery juice, Snapdragon variant does not have that option. 3. Another advantage of Exynos Variant is that Exynos Octa supports full UHS-I speed. That means it supports SD card (micro SDXC UHS-I Pro Class 10 cards) Read speed up to 70 MBps and Write speed up to 20 MBps. 4. Exynos 5422 has the capability to supports hardware-assisted visualization, Snapdragon 801 does not have this.

Why did I choose Samsung over HTC? a) Touchwiz it seems has improved b) Water proof c) Rs 10,000 cheaper d) Removable Battery  Within 48 hours of owning the S5, I knew I won't be able to use this phone, here are the chief reasons I returned it.  You see Samsung has tried to fill in every possible thing in the world into one phone. Their ambition by some distance supersedes my expectations. For this feat I congratulate me. This phone checks your heart rate, has a great 13 megapixel camera (nevermind the lag) , has a finger print scanner (doesnt work great) , gives you 50 GB of dropbox, 1 year of Evernote Premium free, has a great back and doesnt feel plasticky, has Kies internet which allows you access the media on the phone provided you are connected on your mac/pc to the same wifi, has a pretty good battery life, has a wondeful screen..blah blah but here is why I returned it  -&#62; Screen Lag while talking on the phone with someone -&#62; Screen goes off when you are on the phone call because the phone assumes it is against your cheek. While I am sure this setting can be deselected, it was burdensome for me -&#62; The call quality is OK. It is not as good as the iPhone 5. If you are sitting on your desk at work or wherever and the phone's display screen faces you and you turn on the speaker, the speaker sound will be muffled and tinny because &#34;THE SPEAKER IS LOCATED ON THE BACK&#34; ...this is such a big flaw that I don't even know why Samsung calls this is a finished product. -&#62; Interface options compared to iPhone are tremendous but some simple things like browser not customizing itself like iPhone were annoying while web surfing. The iPhone has spoilt me to make sure every website is ACCESSIBLE on my iphone. With S5 there is either a learning curve or NOT AS GOOD browser zoom -&#62; The front facing camera is horrible. The back facing camera has a bit of lag on auto mode. I take videos of the sun when I am driving and the sun is setting sometimes. While this was possible with one hand operation of iPhone, the experience on S5 was terrible -&#62; The phone wants you to have a default email address, the gmail address for google play, Samsung account, Dropbox account, Google Drive account. It wants you to choose what browser it should choose. It wants you to choose your texting client. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Has anyone heard of the paradox of choice? -&#62; Whatsapp on iPhone is 4x better -&#62; Instagram on iPhone is 3x better and more evolved. Especially video uploading. -&#62; buggy music player -&#62; lotta bloatware -&#62; The location of the headphone jack is annoying. Speaker volume is low.  The Good -&#62; Graphics are lovely, lovely to hold in hand, lovely to look at, sometimes the back facing camera takes outstanding pictures but the video doesn't even come close to iPhone..the phone has amazing software for someone who has never used an iPhone they may love it...but for iPhone users this phone is practically impossible to use without complaints.. The battery is 3000MAH , that is massive...the options for Software is amazing..but simple things like a resident book reader is missing and we have to go search for everything. GOOGLE PLAY surprised me. It is amazing, super fast. The options on this phone will astound you. GOOGLE MAPS on S5 was outstanding. YOU CAN HAVE UTORRENT ON THIS!  The bad -&#62; Besides the point I listed above &#34;the good&#34; section,  I Think the phone heats. Bluetooth not as responsive as iPhone. The charging port needs to be set right becuase it has a latch on it. The phone prompts many useless things. The magazine is very buggy. All the Samsung software is not required, should be showcased in a better way, more customizing is neccessary.  I returned to my iPhone 5 and love love love it more than ever.

What I liked:  All basic smart phone functionalities available at low price range. 4.5 inch big screen display. The navigation buttons are on the panel rather than the screen. Free flip cover was of good quality.  What I didn't like:  The back cover of the phone doesn't look & feel good. All the app icons have a border on them which makes the UI look cheap. Touch is not very sensitive. Unable to change independent volume levels. Audio quality is not very good. Front camera has very low MP which is almost unusable.  General:  Battery drain was fair.

Battery: Look for a phone with decent battery life. 1800mAH should be a good start, It will last a full day with 2.5 hrs of talk time and 4 hrs of screen on time.   Set to 2G, Disable GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth and location sharing when not in use, and set brightness to low for a better battery life.   Charge to 80-85% and let it go below 20% before you do a recharge.   Dont over charge the battery to 100%, only once in 15days do a 100% charge.  2. Screen: Go for a screen size above 3.5 with capacitive touchscreen.  A 4 inch screen will be apt to play games, WhatsApp, browse web etc... look for  a minimum resolution of 480\u00d7854 pixels  3. Primary Camera: The rear camera should be at least 5MP but insist for Flash, this will be handy in the night as a torch.  4. Secondary Camera: The front camera of most of the low end phones offer basic less than 1.2MP so dont expect much, Can manage an OK selfie in decent light.  5. Sound: The speaker should be loud enough to make the Ringer heard. Play YouTube videos audible and the Alarm loud. Check all the 3 categories Ringer, Loudspeaker & Alarm.  6. RAM: With the new Android Kit Kat lowering the min specs to 512MB, it will be good to opt for 1GB RAM for smooth video playback and gaming.   Android tends to slow down over time due to multiple App installs and App data. Install and Run Clean Master and uninstall it once its done.  7. Storage: At Least 4GB of internal memory with SD card expandable option.   Delete unwanted photos and video from WhatsApps Received and Send folder.   Move as much photos and videos you can to G+ AutoBackup and save your phone space.   Its easy to share with friends and family the pictures you choose to share.

Resolution of 2560x1440 is incredible for a sharp 5.5&#8221; Quad HD IPS Display.The sharp images with natural looking colors looks awesome.

CAMERA The rear camera is 16MP with Optical Image Stabilization with sharp image quality. It uses laser focus feature of lg g3 for better focusing. High-res 8MP front camera can take good and sharp selfies. It can take video at 4K resolution with very realistic colors.  STORAGE It has got expandable storage feature. Cloud storage is not a very useful feature in Indian context where internet speed and accessibility is still limited compared to western countries. So I love this feature in a smartphone.

The same chipset is seen in many other devices like Xolo Q700S, Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini, Micromax A114 etc. The processor on board is powerful enough to power up apps and games without much issues. There is one big issue though with Desire 310 - this only has 512MB ram while almost all other mediatek powered devices at this price have 1GB Ram. This is really disappointing.  HTC was kind enough to include their Blinkfeed software in this device,which is missing in many other Desire devices priced higher. Since this is a mediatek device,the UI is a Stock Android one,instead of the one you usually see in almost all HTC devices.So in short,the UI looks like any other device from Xolo,Karbonn,Micromax etc,apart from the blinkfeed on the homescreen and the on screen buttons.

It had to be a Quad Core or Octacore processor, at-least 2 GB RAM, and at-least 3000 mAh battery in a and a dual sim phone with 5-5.5 inch screen. My budget was 15-25 thousand. This phone is possible the best available for these specifications at this price. Selection done. My initial few days with this phone has been a breeze. Only suggestion, please start it for the 1st time where you have good wifi connection. Battery life is excellent. I don't need to carry a charger in my pocket anymore. It will easily last you a day (&#62;14-16 hours with heavy usage). I had read somewhere regarding concerns about its audio. Trust me, the DTS is fabulous. The sound quality isn't loud, but clarity is great. The screen isn't a Corning Gorilla Glass, but resolution is great for an optimized HD experience. The Sony BSI camera is OK. Possibly the only thing in this phone which I found could have been better. But it still is problably the best available in this price range. Initially had a few issues with lag in seeing the details of the number clicked on a name in the address-book, but on upgrading the OS (available online for free download), this issue seems resolved. If you want a high performance phone and value your money, go for it. If showing off your branded phone is what you want, and you are more than willing to spend for it, go for a Samsung or iPhone.

I had been using Android phones for last 3 years, but the joy of using this one is uncomparable. I purchased it in september (1.5 months ago). Review is after heavy usage!  a) I dont have to worry about the battery. It comes one full working day. (Am a very heavy user, average 2-3 hours of concalls per day/using mails on phone constantly/on twitter 24*7). b) The interface requires some getting used to. But is very clean! c) Angry birds/Temple run/asphalt etc., are nice. NO LAG whatsoever d) I dropped the phone accidentally 3-4 times over the floor- No damage wahtsover! e) Speaker Phone is extremely good f) Touch Screen is as good as it can be. g) MS office is awesome. I can edit excel sheets with ease. navigate through the outlook as good as I can on my lappie. Did not miss my laptop while travelling on a vacation! (Ofcourse, family was unhappy :-p) h) Only Drawback- Camera is not good. Very Basic. Buy Another phone ONLY if you want a good camera or loads of dirty interface apps ;-)  UPDATE after 3.5 months of use.  Am still loving it!  a) I dropped the phone a dozen times on the floor (by mistake of course) and on one occassion broke the screen and replaced the lcd from a local service centre (costed be ~2.5k vs 4.5k from a nokia care). b) continuing to love the speed of emails. c) twitter and some apps have slightly slowed down and there is a slight lag. wondering if this is because i have not inserted a sd card yet and there is already whole loads of data on the phone memory. will clean up the phone (or install a memory card) and update in next 1/2 weeks. d) voice and clarity continues to be awesome e) most apps working well and crisp.

The viewing angles are good.There is also no light sensor which means Auto brightness feature is not there.  Processor : Dual-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A5 processor.

Fast enough to swap applications. *Can play HD videos *3G with speed of 21mbps  Cons: (At this price u can't expect much so its not really cons)  *only 130 mb internal storage (some times it shows low internal memory error while installing app) *Useless pre-installed apps likie hike messenger, opera mini, 3 in 1 bubbles which unnecessarily absorbs your internal memory which we definitely don't need in this. *2M camera(decent enough). U cant expect 5m camera with flash at this price. * Battery is ok for light users.  Recommendation:  At the end it is a very decent phone and a steal deal at this price.

Connectivity (calling, Wi-fi etc), call quality is satisfactory. Battery life much better than the competition.  However  being a low priced phone , there are some short comings:  1> Screen is not bright enough 2> Touch is a bit sluggish. 3> FM not working as expected 4> Camera is just average 5> Build quality (plastic) is average  Those who are on budget or want to try Windows OS or want a backup phone , this is perhaps the best one could find.

Superior battery & memory tilted the scale in 525s BLACK favour. (I am glad it did as I feel so happy to watch my li'l ones aiding their 'action heroes' negotiate challenges thrown at them with ease & definitely without hiccups.  Reasons for buying Lumia 525 Black: - Found windows to be non-intrusive. I say this because I have heard several of my colleagues complaining about Google's penchant for collating/culling infomation from various sources viz emails, facebook etc & putting it right there in your contacts without knowing whether the bonafide owner really finds this useful. - Decent looking, elegant (not eye catching), NOT FLASHY (no chrome plating or silver borders here), silent worker. - Had been a great fan of Nokia's DRIVE, NOKIA Music & NOKIA Maps. As an avid runner & driving entusiast, mapping my speed at different terrains & finding routes have been greatly eased since I owned an N8.  My son is hooked to NOKIA maps too. - Looked like a perfect gift for a person uninitiated to the ever expanding technological  world of  mobility. (I was not disappointed at all)  Experience post buying: - No issues with Windows OS. Albeit, we find it more intuitive, smooth, hiccup free & simple. - Completely satisfied.  One aspect which every buyer of the phone should know before-hand which I was unaware of: The ALARM function of the phone works only with phone in ON condition. I found out after having missed my running schedule once. Now its almost a fortnight since the phone found its way into our lives, we have made peace with this aspect although we do miss the feature as there are very bright chances that unwarranted phone calls jolts u out of sleep in the middle of the night. (We had the habit of switching off our mobiles before closing for the day).  Final word... Health conscious people looking for sub 10000 phones, having passion for the outdoors, wanting to break the clutter & not apprehensive of embracing a new platform can readily take the plunge. The journey would be joyful & you will surely have lots of fun & pleasant surprises along the way.  So...

For those who are still thinking about the apps, one quick info - only Microsoft and Apple checks every apps before its put In the marketplace. Android has lots of apps, but most of them are buggy, they either drain out your battery or consume all the resources which results in poor performance. Every app in windows store is verified for its quality and you can be sure, it wont slow down your phone. In android if you install a few apps, the phone will start slowing down.

With Samsung, HTC and Apple leading the Smartphone wars, Nokia was left miles back. Surprising enough, Nokia struck back with its most impressive line of mobile phones till date. Joining forces with Microsoft was a very smart move for Nokia. Instead of developing its own OS, it went for Windows 8, and left all the marketing of OS to Microsoft.  When I heard the price of Lumia 510 (precursor to Lumia 520), I was taken aback. 10k for windows 7.5 phone! Still I waited for an update to Windows 8. That's when Lumia 520 was launched. But for some reason or the other, I couldn't buy it. Then one day I saw the price 6999/- and bought it immediately online. Don't regret it one bit. The best smartphone I ever had.  Pros:  1. Build Quality: Superb. On par with higher line of Lumia series. Matt Finish is just wonderful. 2. Screen size: Prefect for me. At 4\" inches, this beauty is no doubt an amazing buy! 3. Display: While it does not have clear text technology of Lumia 620, it's nevertheless every bit its worth. Only downside is reading in sunshine is not as clear as Lumia 620. 4. Interface: Truly Elegant.If you think Android/iOS is elegant/user friendly,give this beauty a try. You'll be astounded. 5. Apps: All essential apps available. Though apps are not in the counts of Android Marketplace or App Store, you won't be disappointed as all essential apps we use daily are available. 6. Office 365: Full MS office suit. Though many may not use this, I use MS Word quite regularly. 7. Colors: Amazing bright colors. Could easily give Samsung a run for its money that only launches mobiles in Black and White.  Cons: 1. Front Camera: Not a deal breaker though. At 7k (or even 10k), I expect nothing more. 2. Radio: Not a deal breaker. I usually use Tune In (Internet Radio) 3. Flash: No LED Flash. Now this was disappointing. They could have added it. 4. RAM: 512 MB Ram. Even though processor is 1GHz and Windows 8 demand less RAM, 1 GB could have added more value to the product.

The transition from a simplest basic mobile to the Smartphone could never be more easier, thanks to Nokia Lumia 520 and Windows 8.  I do not know much technical bits to appraise this mobile, but i can state many of its advantages from a layman's angle.  1. Excellent build quality- I dropped it on a cement road from my bicycle to find it in three pieces. But nothing was damaged. 2. For it's primary usage as a phone- Excellent voice quality, speaker phone is at its best. Signal reception is also very good. SMS Interface is very different than regular basic phones and i found it to be quite innovative. 3. Screen size of 4' is quite appropriate. It fits in your palm well and goes in the packet very nicely. 4. Display quality is excellent. It may not have the best viewing angle though, but for a single viewer, you get the best. 5. Windows 8 feels amazing. Very user friendly, desktop kind of interface and positioning of apps could not be more simple. 6. It will not be wise to ignore Windows phones thinking that it does not have enough apps. You would find apps for almost all of your needs. 7. The most beautiful feature i found is the Kid's Corner. Here, you can create different profile for your kid. And you will be at peace, while your child is trying her hands at your mobile. With this profile, your child can not make any outgoing calls or can not mend with your important files in the phone.  Though, there are some limitations as below.  1. There is no front camera, but what more can you expect in a budget phone. 2. No radio. But for me, it doesn't matter. I do have best radio apps downloaded in my phone. 3. There is no key to search within mobile, instead there is a key that takes you to the web search engine- Bing. I can't justify a separate key only to search over web. 4. Lack of Dual SIM. Don't understand why Nokia does not have this.  Overall, i found this to be the best smartphone with a budget below 10K.  Go for it even if your budget is more than it. It is worth for each and every paisa!"], ["3.0", "Need reply", "SENTHIL NATHAN", "Hi, actually now I got time to share about my product what I have purchased from you.First of all I brought it online instead retail shops with this much spent because of the site named amazon.in my phone having some defects like 1)the second call name and number is not appearing during the phone call when data services not in use but,if I am using data services,all things is going good.2)some of the times,the size of the fonts are getting big and I cannot resize it.in this times I need to restart my phone.3)the phone was strucking unexpectedly,at this time it is making me to remove the battery and needs reinsert into it.4)final thing is I can't find my service warranty.Hope you will understand what I am facing with the product.Revert me with positive cheers."], ["4.0", "Good product but manufacturing flaws mar the quality", "icubyx", "I ordered this product based on the positive reviews I received on all forums.

Sony has come up with a good value for money product without compromising on the build quality and the UI to a large extent. The outer body does feel quite good and even after a good deal of time spent on the web there was no heating issues. The battery back up is simply amazing on this device. Low to medium usage sustains the phone for almost two days (no gaming). The UI is eye catching with sharp animations and a good feel. However Sony could have improved their secondary camera for this model and could have increased the screen resolution. Another down point for the phone is the limited internal memory but that can be solved with an external sd card. An android L update is not expected however sony does roll out a few updates for bug fixes. Greatest feature is the brilliant battery and the worst  is the external speaker at the back (calls are awful on speaker). Overall the phone is quite good in the budget segment but not the best. It provides a good user experience and is quite snappy even while multi tasking and switching between five to six apps (not games)."], ["4.0", "BIGGEST CON TO BE CONSIDERED", "abhishek k.", "Biggest.

And, if by chance, you have rotated it by mistake, it will take eternity to come back to original. Forget about playing games on it. I learned it hard way and had to disable the feature itself.  2. Some times, I was not able to receive incoming calls as the slide function won't work. It happened very random but happened for sure. I checked Lenovo forum, checked other website, but couldn't find solution. I checked with one of my friend who bought same phone about 2months back, he was also facing same issue.

This was the first Asha phone to have 3G connection, 3G has better signal reception than 2G in addition to it's more speed. This is a GSM phone and requires a normal sized SIM. When I bought mine Nokia was giving a free over the ear headphone, 20 free games from EA and free music on it's music app for a couple of months. I didn't receive the free over the ear headphone. There weren't that many good games on EA and free music soon expired. In the box you receive the phone, battery, power adapter, earphones and manual. You won't receive any USB cable to connect to your computer or laptop. You have to buy that separately spending around Rs. 300 in a Nokia store. I got a 2GB micro SD instead of 4 GB. New ones come with 1 year limited warranty.  This is not a smartphone, this is dummy phone with extra features. There are lot better alternatives in Android from local market here in India. If you want a smartphone at this price range you better consider phones from Micromax, Lava, etc.  In India, Nokia wrongly advertised this phone's single core 1 Ghz processor as perfect for mobile gaming but the gaming on this phone looks like gaming from early generation like 16-bit era, even the 3D games look blocky. Don't be fooled by the sleek images Nokia puts out for this phone. This phone uses series 40 OS which is not as good as Android or Windows, Nokia provides it's own version of apps for Facebook, Twitter and WhatApp, Line, mail, etc which I haven't tried, I feared that these apps might steal my username and password, there is no Instagram app.  It's screen size is approximately 1.9 inches horizontally and 2.7 inches vertically, not big, Nokia advertises it's screen size as 3 inches, I guess they measure it diagonally. Websites appear small but you can zoom and enlarge the text. Flash videos on any website don't play. Because of it's small RAM of 128 MB and other hardware limitations you can forget about reading any ebooks. I tried to load many ebooks of many formats including PDF but none opened. It doesn't have a built in app to handle PDFs you have to download a third party app.  Photos and videos taken with 3.2 MP camera with the back cover on look blurry and washed out. One of the reasons for bad quality photos and videos is the plastic transparent on the back cover. If you take photos and videos without the back cover they are lot clean in good light and passable. But you should be careful while doing this as the battery falls out. The camera interface doesn't give control over shutter speed, ISO settings, although it does have exposure control and effects(like negative, sepia, etc), frames and fun sounds which you can choose for your camera shutter. There is also an option to turn on grid in the camera interface which I never found helpful but I guess it helps in framing the shot.  It has 2 buttons on the right side(when the phone is viewed from the front), the lock/unlock button gets stuck a lot and doesn't function.  The bluetooth communication is fast when the communicating devices are close and WiFi connection is also fast depending on your connection. To turn on or off the bluetooth and WiFi you have to slide down an interface from the top of the screen where you can also select the sound profile and turn on or off the mobile service internet connection. This interface also serves as the notification center showing you the number of missed calls and unread messages.  Contacts don't have grouping feature and the search in contact is also not efficient. Call logs and message logs don't allow you to sort them by day, week and month view. There is a limit to the number of notes you can make, this phone has alarm feature which you can use to wake yourself up, I tried it once but I don't remember hearing it's alarm. This alarm shows cute graphic on the screen at the set time.  It allows you to choose from different color themes, the official green theme looks a lot like yellow. You can use any JPEG or GIF of a certain dimension as the wallpaper.  Even when bluetooth, mobile internet connection and WiFi are always off, the battery lasts only a day or so with moderate usage.  The only good thing is the call quality when the signal reception is good, speaker on the other end sound as if they are in the same room with you.  All in all if you don't rely heavily on your mobile phone for social media and internet browsing this can be good depending on your needs.

Review in a nutshell: LOUSY instrument.  Problems: 1. Within 2 days of beginning use, things went wrong. I took it to a nearby XOLO dealer who said the OS had to be reinstalled. The back-up of the contacts list failed to work and I lost all the contacts I had imported from my previous phone (a nice good old Nokia Asha!).  2. Within a couple of weeks after this, the phone developed problems:   (a) The blue tooth would not connect with my:   (i) MacBook Pro laptop   (ii) Bluetooth ear-piece   (b) The data cable connection did not work, so I could not transfer files between my MacBook Pro and the additional SD card I had installed in the phone.  3. I took it to the authorized service centre. \"We have to reinstall the OS, sir.\" Okay. By this time, I had found a way of backing up the data on google. After the OS was reinstalled:   (a) The blue tooth connection problem persisted.   (b) The front camera (the one facing the user) just disappeared as an option from the camera.   (c) No matter which compass app I downloaded, it just would not work -- orientation error message of some kind.   (d) The GPS worked with Google map app but not with anything else (this is important because I need to use geographical apps for the geography education work I do with school kids; which is one of the reasons that I bought this phone anyway!)   (e) The data cable still did not communicate with the laptop.  4.  On 27 June 2014, in the morning, when I tried to switch the phone on, it would not turn on. It had died! That is when I decided to take it to the Authorized Service Centre.  5. The service centre said the problems are too many and we have to send it back to the factory for repair or replacement. It will take 25 DAYS (as of 27 June 2014)!! They also said that the company will not refund the purchase amount; they will only repair or replace with another instrument. The Amazon return-by-date had expired. So, now I am stuck with getting a replacement instrument that I really have no interest in because I don't *at all* trust the quality of a XOLO phone.  6.  Amazon.in has facilitated the sale of an utter dud of a telephone. This is a serious black mark on Amazon.in.  They are seeking to enter the Indian market in a big way and want clearance from the Government of India? My experience with this purchase leads me to *oppose* granting of clearance from the Gov. of India.  7.  I am *deeply dissatisfied* with the quality of the phone I received and I am *very very disappointed* that Amazon.in would sell such a low-quality product.  8.  My inconvenience from the date I switched over to this phone has to be somehow addressed and redressed by Amazon.in. I expect to hear from them within 7 days from today (30 June 2014) after which I will decide my course of action, including complaining against both the manufacturer and Amazon.in to the Consumer Court.  9.  I do NOT recommend XOLO to anyone. I have actively dissuaded several friends from buying this phone. This is a very very poor product.  10.  I will also not purchase merchandise from Amazon.in in the future, if they do not respond to this review.  11.  I am forced to give this item some star rating ... it deserves NONE.

Accelerometer,Proximity and Light sensor are included.  This device has GLONASS in built,Global navigation satellite systems developed by Russia for better location tracking.  The 5MP Camera quality is average. The video can be recorded at 720P,but the quality is below average. The camera app has some bugs and often throws \"Camera cannot be connected error\". You need to restart in order to use the camera again.  1080p video playback is supported out of the box. USB on the go is also supported with which you can plugin your usb pendrives and play multimedia files.  Popular games like Temple Run,Subway surfers etc can be played without any issues. The battery is a 2000mAh one which can power it for 1 day of average use.  Apps can be moved/installed on to the sdcard.

{"url": "http://www.amazon.in/Vivo-X3S-White/dp/B00RN7D5L4", "reviews": [["4.0", "Excellent Audiophile Phone", "KNReddy", "The aim of the review  is to help the searching people by providing accurate info, I have tried it as a token of gratitude to contributing netgens, since I am taking regular info from net , though  I am having  very limited time to contribute.  The phone is having FunOS. it is comparable to any launcher over android OS. It is customized to meet the requirements and  to give a wonderful user experience. It's Dialer is Ok , Messages is having additional facility of sending Vcard as an attachment / text (better than old Nokia facility), The icons are beautiful, pleasant &legible. Colour combinations of icons over black wallpaper are excellent. It is having iManager, which is powerful enough to speed up / clean RAM and close any installed apps. It is having useful facility of white list, so that it will not kill the apps included in the white list. Hence you may not need any rooting of the phone at all. It is having only 1GB RAM, but no lag at all.  Alarm tone is nature's sound & very pleasant. Ring tones are excellent. Selectable HiFi mode. Cameras, both rear & front are good. Good signal catching. Ring tone volume is OK (at maximum level).  Probably Vivo made so many customizations / refinements, it  takes lot of efforts & time  to bring new versions like kitkat,lollipop etc with the same excellent user interface.Android app short cuts  are installed on screen like IOS, hence  no app button in latest Firmware version. Settings are similar to IOS (these are the changes with respect to stock) . But it is fully compatible Android. Probably they have aimed at IOS like user experience with android flexibility.  When it comes to audio quality, most of the phones fail to impress audiophile & initially many of the users may not pay attention to audio quality. So I have compared (At EQUIVALENT VOLUMES for both RMAA & subjective listening)  the Audio quality  of Vivo X3S to many phones like Iphone 4 (It was reference to any phone in audio quality with flat frequency response, low noise & IMD, very low output impedance in the range of 1ohm, excellent stereo cross talk etc) , Iphone 4S,  Nokia E52, Samsung A3, Samsung S III & USB sound card FIIO E07,  probably VivoX3S is one of the best phone for bundled IEM / 16 ohm impedance ear phones/ IEMs  in audiophile point of view [The frequency response is not as flat as iphone4,but the difference is negligible (+0.3db)]. However FIIO E07 with any android phone  (with OTG) or PC (USB) tops the list and beats Iphone 4 in every parameter. Even veteran Nokia E52 performs very well, far better than iphone 4 (at equal Volume level) except in Stereo Cross talk. Vivo X3S supports native 44.1 kHz playback which is also important for music fidelity. It may be noted, HiFi is available only headphone mode. In fact non HiFi mode is also fared reasonably well. The phone is bundled with excellent 16 ohm impedance IEM/Earphone; you may not need to purchase any additional IEM/ earphone / headphone. However if you are purchasing a phone with music listening as an important parameter, please have a demo before the decision (it is applicable to any audio device). The latest / costliest need not be the best e.g as on date, many latest phones have native sampling frequency support for 48kHz not for 44.1 kHz.Surprisingly all features of X3S are excellent except few limitations given below.  However I have few reasons to root the phone. 1) Though it supports OTG, FIIO E07 was not working, as USB storage is implemented at another level. However this can be fixed by app USB Host Check  if rooted. (the music quality of X3S is so high, anything better may be beyond human hearing capacity or atleast negligible, so FIIO E07 may not be needed or unnecessary bulky) 2) FunOS is desig is wonderful,still one common  option of change of font size is missing, though the existing font size is OK, this can be fixed with BigFont app but it needs rooting (I want larger size font to compensate my eye sight,  which is at the manageable level). 3) The In call volume level is normal at maximum setting, but  I want little bit higher volume like Moto G or Razr M, so i want to explore any possibility to increase the gain through rooting. (Call Volume Booster app may used to keep in call volume to max in auto, at the time of calling/call receiving) 4) Messages  is in conversation mode (like all others android phones, inbox / sent /outbox/draft/custom folder are not available, however Pansi SMS can be used but up to Android-KitKat version as the developer stopped the development, as on date)  Other Limitations / deficiencies. 1) Clipping at 0000% is occurring (0000% has no meaning, but error message is appearing) during RMAA,  even if specified line in / volume levels are set to calibrated value, 2) It accepts 16 ohm impedance IEM / load  very well (But at 32 ohm impedance load,  frequency response etc were lower than 16 ohms, whereas  the sound  performance of other phones was better with higher impedance loads). 3) Notification LED is not multi color (only green) 4) The length of the phone is high at 143 mm (it is higher side for even for 5&#34; screen), I prefer phone length of less than 130 mm,  but No HiFi model is available with the lower length. 5) FM Radio sensitivity is poor compared to MotoG but approximately equivalent to Nokia E52. Very poor compared to stand alone radio.  I am happy to say that I am unable to find any other deficiency in the phone as the date of review.  Downgrading & Rooting Vivo X3S It is shipped with firmware version PD1227BW_EX_A_2.7.0 which is not rootable with any of the available tools like kingoroot-1.3.9, RootGenius_1.8.7, Iroot v1.8.5. Hence the following method used to downgrade & root. The following is the experience sharing for Vivo X3S only (please do not be confused with Vivo Xplay 3s, it is a different model), you are responsible for your actions. Never ever flash / update the ROM not meant for that phone (i.e. make, model, model-variation etc are to be same)  Downgrade  1. Put Zip package firmware version PD1227BW_EX_A_1.24.7  in phone internal storage (IMPORTANT). [at present PD1227BW_EX_A_1.24.7  or lower version are rootable) -Firmware can be downloaded from http://www.vivoglobal.com/download/5.html 2. Enter recovery. Entering the recovery mode: - Turn off your phone. - Hold and press the volume up key + power key together about 10 second. - Use volume keys to  shift &#34;selection&#34;  on to  Recovery Mode. - Press Power key to enter the Recovery Mode. 3)  Use volume keys to  shift &#34;selection&#34;  on to  Wipe data/factory reset  & press power button , now  shift &#34;selection&#34; to  user data.... '.yes  again through volume keys & press power button. 4)  Use volume keys to  shift &#34;selection&#34;  on to Select Wipe Cache & press power button 5. Use volume keys to  shift &#34;selection&#34; on  to  Apply update from internal SDCard & press power key to select it , now select your zip package ,  depends where you put it. 6. Wait patiently till setup is complete.  ROOTING  CAUTION & RISKS INVOLVED: i. The built in counter of phone permanently records rooting info, even if you un-root it,  this will not reset. Hence warranty may be void. In view of this, rooting may not be advisable, atleast before reliability of hardware is established. As the risk lies with user (advanced & willing) & not with m/s Vivo, it is a win-win situation, as the Vivo is not locking the OS, like IOS or boot locked Andoid by Moto. Further the above downgrade method works only if phone enters into recover mode hence may not be suitable to bring back the bricked phone(which may need different flashing method, which is not known at present). In view of this & Vivo has done many useful tweaks, rooting may not be required at all. ii. Even if you rooted the phone, never delete or even edit any system file or to that extent any file (even if you have right tools & knowledge, if not executed properly the phone may not boot after next restart). iii. If you select 'allow' out of allow / deny for any program, when asks for root permission on your rooted phone,c  it means,  you are giving administrative rights to that program.  1) Install USB drivers &#34;All MTK USB Driver 2014 &#34; on Windows PC (may be googled to download) 2) download and install any one of rooting tools like kingoroot-1.3. or RootGenius_1.8.or Iroot v1.8.5 (I have used Iroot) (may be googled to download) on Windows PC. 3) open the application in PC & connect the Vivo X3S to PC through USB cable , now on the debugging mode on phone ( unlike other android phones,  this option may not be available before connecting to PC. However full developer mode can be accessible by dialing * # * # 7777 # * # *) 4) Click on root & wait (Un-root option is also available at options of app) Phone will be rooted condition, may be checked with root checker."], ["5.0", "Five Stars", "Kumar Niraj", "Best phone ever in this price range completely value for money.satisfied"], ["4.0", "Four Stars", "Zaheer", "Value for money n touch n air gestures are outstanding value for money"], ["5.0", "satisfied.", "g Kiran kumar", "Outstanding performance and value for money.satisfied."], ["1.0", "One Star", "VINAY KUMAR", "Good"]], "title": "Vivo X3S (White)"}

Viewing angles are good though.  2) This is powered by a MTK 6582M Quad-core 1.3GHz Processor which performs on par with the popular Mtk6589 processor. The GPU on board is a Mali-400 MP. It performs better than the usual GPU, PowerVR SGX 544MP, seen in mtk6589 devices like Micromax Turbo,Xolo 3000 etc.Gaming performance is great for the price.  (Note : GSMArena lists this has a PowerVR SGX 544MP GPU which is an error, gfxbenchmark website clearly shows it has a Mali-400 MP )  3) 1 GB Ram, which has now become a standard in 10K+ devices, allows lag free multitasking.  4) Jellybean 4.2.2 - Not the latest,but still new and better than 4.1 Jellybean. Im not sure whether this device will ever get updates to 4.3 or 4.4. No word from lenovo yet.

You can get around 2 days of average use with low brightness settings.  6) Camera - 5 MP Rear and VGA Front Cam. Photo quality is not good.  7) Storage -  You CANNOT move or install apps to the sdcard,so you are stuck with around 2 GB of internal memory for apps and games installation,which is not enough if you plan to install a lot of games.  Overall a good huge device with decent specs,but priced a little higher. Camera quality and Internal memory are the key downsides of this device."], ["4.0", "Lenovo A850 Detailed Review (Phone used and then reviewed)", "hemant", "I purchased this product a couple of days back from a local shop in the exchange for my previous Galaxy Nexus, which i had to change because of the battery backup. I had to stick to a tight budget of 15k so i brought this piece and so far I am really happy with it. The pros and cons are as follow:  PROS: 1) The looks of the phone are very good. 2) The built quality is superb, overall the looks and the built makes it a premium device, so no doubt there. 3) The screen is big i.e 5.5 inches. Surprisingly big for this price range. 4) The Mediatek MTK 6582M at 1.3 GHz performs too good. Beats all phones in below 20k range and some above 20k too, for eg: like Galaxy Grand(both), Mega 5.8, Sony Xperia C etc and i guess it equals Xperia SP. Mediatek MTK 6582M performs better than MTK 6589 and even MTK 6589T and hence beats all Mediatek powered local brand phones. 5) Benchmarks: Antutu - ( 17,100), Quadrant - (6001) and Nenamark - (full 60fps) which is amazing. 6) GPU is Mali-400MP2 which is certainly better than Power VR SGX544 which is almost in all local mediatek powered phones. 6) RAM is 1 GB out of which you get 972 MB usable which is excellent. There is well more than 600 MB RAM free before installing apps. 7) Dual sim. 8) Sound is very loud and good. Not excellently clear but very load and reasonably clear and definitely audible. 9) In-call volume and clarity is good. 10) Music quality in my headphones is good. I haven't tested the stock headphones. 11) Comes with android 4.2.2 installed. 12) Memory can be expanded to 32 GB via micro sd card. 13) Nice and clearly visible notification LED. 14) Lenovo launcher is highly customizable. 15) Pricing is very very good.  NEUTRAL POINTS:  1) Battery is good but not excellent. I feel Lenovo made a mistake by giving only 2250 mAh battery to power such a huge screen. It should have been atleast 2500 mAh; but nonetheless it still gives me a good 24 hours of battery life with 3G always on and mild - moderate usage. Should definitely last u through workday hours i.e from morning 10 to evening 8 or something with moderate usage. Ultimately this depends on user to user. One can use the provided Lenovo power app to maximize the battery life. 2) The speaker's loudness sometimes tears the voice. 3) The speaker at times gets covered by surfaces and blocks the sound. I would blame the design of the phones for this. 4) Awkward positioning of buttons. Power button on top and volume button on the right. 5) Its fairly long time since 4.3 has released Lenovo should give it out to its customers now. This should have come with it.  CONS:  1) Camera is not good at all. Lens is not upto the mark. Bad decision of giving only 5mp of camera in these days..seriously who gives 5mp of camera nowadays!? Front camera is just VGA. Should haven been atleast 8mp rear and 1.3 mp on the front. 2) Too big, Its very very big. A screen of 5 inches or even 5.3 inches like that of S920 would have been better. 3) Resolution is bad for this screen size. As is said in the previous point a screen of 5 inches with this resolution would have been better. 4) Internal memory is just 4 GB out of which you get 2.07 GB for use. I don't like this trend of giving just 4 GB of internal memory. Its too less for installing apps. Moreover you can't transfer apps to your sd card, so you are stuck with 2.07 GB of space for apps unless you root. Should have been atleast 8 GB of internal storage. 5) No Gorilla glass.  Deducting one star for battery capacity and all cons.  VERDICT:  A nice tight budget phone with hefty performance and reasonably good battery life(which could have been better). If you are on a budget of less than 17k then you should definitely close your eyes and go for it.

Photo quality is not good.  7) Storage -  You CANNOT move or install apps to the sdcard,so you are stuck with around 2 GB of internal memory for apps and games installation,which is not enough if you plan to install a lot of games.

I find both very negative. So if you would like to know what are the thoughts and experiences with this product, kindly read on. Thank you  First things first - I was completely taken by surprise by this product. I used to be a very brand conscious person. I used a Nokia C6-01 for around 4 years and also used a Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 for quite some time. Both these phone during their days were kings and they served me really well. My Nokia sadly stopped responding to the touches I made to its screen making me finally settle on the decision to buy a new phone. I never had been a crazy phone user. Yeah, I do love cool phones. Come on, I am 21. My friends keep changing their flagship phones each time something new comes out. But I honestly like the desktop interface and large screen of my Macbook to write and read my mails, watch movies, click random shots of the world around me specially when I can take out my camera (I am a professional travel and fashion photographer), edit my pictures giving them professional touches and finally see vibrant colors of my pictures. But I always needed a more mobile platform to perform these function, specially when I am on the move. So I decided to get a proper smartphone that could really help me out. As any ambitious mobile freak, I searched for the flagships of the giants, Nokia, Samsung, Sony, HTC. And all I could say was - Out of my budget. A bit disheartened I searched the midrange product of these very same brands. Again no luck. The midrange simply miss out on either one or more from my essentials list. Not knowing what to do, I decided to go with one of the midrange of any of the brands completely knowing I won't be happy. That's when my dad said to look for Lenovo. The god in PC manufacturing, I gave this brand a look. I was taken away by the 4000 mah battery phones. They really seemed surreal. I searched further. Read reviews. Saw many complaints about the custom OS and many other issues. But still I decided to go ahead with this particular model, Vibe X, having a feeling that it would be good. And here goes how did it fare with me -  1) It's super thin. Very difficult to hold without a case (I had to buy a Nilkin Leather Flip cover for it, from Amazon itself). But wait. It's the best phone to hold. Very light in weight and the laser carved design at the back has amazing feedback.  2)The OS. Yes, the custom launcher is heavy but that can be fixed by placing a more functional Launcher like Nova. And it is upgradable to KitKat 4.4  3)The hardware buttons are metal and have great touch.  4)The phone is fast, specially after KitKat and Nova. But the RAM gets clogged up fast. This makes the phone fractionally slow making me to shut unnecessary apps and I am back to god like speeds.  5)The phone automatically switches to a know wifi network when I reach home or my workplace even when I didn't turn it on. I haven't used a newer android phone after Xperia X10, so don't know if it exists in any but I found this very useful.  6)Network reception is good. 3G, 2G all set. Call volumes are great. The earpiece fixed speaker is a monster. Scary me every-time the phone rings. Sound is clear. There is this feature were you bring your phone near to your ear when the phone is ringing and the call connects. This can't be used in general mode because the speaker is at the earpiece and will permanently shut down your ear. You can ever make a call to a person by opening their contact card and bring the earpiece close to your ear.  7)The screen is huge, brighter and the colors are excellent and not over saturated like the Samsung Amoleds. The details are really good. The 440 ppi is a truth  8)Both the cameras are really good. A bit soft at the back but after the editing it looked really sharp and free of noise.  9)The battery is a bit of a let down. Will definitely have to try some conserving tricks and invest in a power bank.  10)The OTG doesn't seem to work. Hope we get a fix via a update. Because this becomes a serious issue. It's a 16 GB internal memory with no expansion. And is the OTG doesn't work, we are in serious trouble. Lenovo seriously needs to fix this issues. I actually settled for the non memory expansion phone hoping OTG would work.  Otherwise, its a amazing phone. I really wished it was dual sim and had a bigger battery. But its perfect. I don't regret buying this product and a big thumbs up for Lenovo for the hardwork they put in this product. Thanks for reading my review. Hope it helps. P.S-Excited about the K series from Lenovo.

I myself had to place an order online with a Singapore based exporter for a new display for my P51 after leaving my phone for 40 days at the authorized service-cum-repair shop in my hometown. Jaina Marketing failed to supply the screen for this model so there's nothing this guy running the service-cum-repair shop could do about it. I inquired at a few unauthorized centres but all of them told me the same thing: Panasonic P51's screen is unavailable in the market. I finally found relief when I received the shipment from Singapore and then I had my P51's smashed screen replaced for Rs.1000 (Although the overall cost was Rs.6700) This sad episode led me to think that buying this phone is a tricky affair; you get great value for your money but, God forbid, if your phone breaks down, you may face a very difficult time getting it fixed."], ["4.0", "good worthy mobile.", "K SREEDHAR", "Good mobile.

I ignored this problem initially but now its getting bigger and bigger day by day. I think the problem is with GPS receiver or it could be anything.  My question to you is, Have you solved this problem or not. If yes, then I can send my handset to you or If its no then you should focus on the existed customer because by advertizing on TV you will get nothing, learn from xiaomi or many others.  The reason behind direct contacting to you is, My friend got the same handset with same problem and he had gone to one of nearest customer care in Ahmedabad,Gujarat. After one month, I think its too much for anyone to solve the problem, he got his handset back with same problem. So if you are doing this kind of cheating with customer then there is no point for customer care. That's why I am asking you prior that if you are capable of repairing this handset then only I should send mine.  The other problem is battery life. I have to say that you are not living up to customer's expectation.

Definitely, lasts very long and has a long-long standby time. I've compared it with Samsung galaxy S3, on AnTuTu benchmark, and results were surprisingly good for xolo Q1011. Performance wise, it nearly equals the S3 as per the AnTuTu results.

The two cons of this phone are : 1)  It has really low inbuilt memory 4GB(Should have been at least 8GB) 2)  It has a non-removable battery.( Not a prob. so far)  Many pros are : 1) It is having good rear cam with BSI sensors( Front camera is also good) 2) Screen is a visual treat 3) Really really improved battery backup ( May be coz of Li-polymer) 4) Enough of RAM remains free always so it delivers a lag free performance always, may be coz of kitkat os(as i am a hardcore gamer and always have lots of apps installed on my phone, hence mentioned).

Thanx to amazon for quick delivery. First of all am reviewing Xolo Q1200 with my first time user experience. Xolo brand is a pretty gud for guys who looking for all type of mobile and tabs. Xolo Q1200 is a mid range phone with great features. Its powered by 1.3Ghz quadcore mediatek processor, 1Gb Ram. The big 5inch display with 294 PPi is beautiful in color reproduction, its also protected with corning gorilla glass 3- u can forget about scratches... 8gb internal memory and support of 32Gb is gud. (in internal 4 gb is user available). OTG support to connect pendrive, joystick etc. Currently in Jelly bean, xolo promised a Kitkat update. they released one beta Kitkat version too..But its not stable. so, its gud to stay with jelly bean until stable Kitkat version is released. 2000mah battery power up the device and it gave me a full day backup with Connected in wifi. Overall its a decent phone in this range. main things i need to highlight is it camera, great cam in low light conditions, thanks to Sony EXMOR sensor technology. Front cam is average. Games running smoothly. Even its 5inch its handy and stylish. Gesture and hands free features are good. Volume in speakers is great. Maybe because of 2 speakers powered by DTS. SRS certified.  The things that i worried little is, there is no notification led. Little bit heavy (maybe its gud for some users, boldly stick on hands). Performance of headset is average.. Bass very poor. Treble is ok. But the new design of head set is stunning...  Thanx Xolo for Giving freebies like premium leather finished flip cover, Screen guard and OTG.

Same RAM, phone memory, GPU, clock speed, processor type etc. But it has better performance that this for greater age.  Pros: Battery life. Way, way good. Practically, double than that of Samsungs' and HTCs' for same rate. Camera. (Obviously, Sony has to deliver it.)  Cons: Lags, irresponsiveness to the extent that you cannot write on a vertical screen, you have to rotate it everytime. Making it lite doesn't help."]], "title": "Sony Xperia J ST26i (Black)"}

Awesome display and design is good(generally BB mobile screen looks small but this mobile doesnt disappoint us regarding big screen/touch experience) Touch is too good Typing experience(No need to say about BB keypad i guess) is too good which is one of my major requirement as i am not a touch freak...I wanted a QWERTY keypad mobile which this one served very well Voice / music clarity is awesome Emails/documents on the go is a treat! Individual profiles creation for office or work emails is awesme and security wise(locking applications with passwords) is also it serves the best!!!  Cons: Battery drains and switches off the next morning if its below 40% over the night(i have expected for 24hrs of standby atleast with internet ON but without internet Just for calls too its the same case) Camera in low light conditions its bad exposure...!! if sufficient light is there it serves the purpose!!

Previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy Note. Used it for a good 2 years, and I can tell you that I will never go back to a samsung again, ever. This time I wanted a phone that FELT like a phone. My fav phone of all time was my old nokia E71. It was slim, solid, built to last, everything was a click away, needed only one hand to operate and did everythin u wanted a smart phone to do. Basically, I use my phone for CONNECTIVITY: SMS, Calls, emails, social networking, browsing.....in addition, a decent camera, an occasional game So it was decided that I wanted to go back to a qwerty. And the best qwertys these days are made by BB. So did my research, took the plunge and BOY am I GLAD!  Like all the previous reviewer said, if what you need from a phone is connectivity; look no further than this.  PROS: 1.THAT KEYBOARD.....work of art...anyone who loves a physical keyboard will absolutely trip on this 2.Great call quality (a given when it comes to BB) 3.You tend to get reception ANYWHERE. Never out of range.(compared to my old samsung) 4.The BATTERY. Although not close to the legendary micromax, it trumps all the other smartphones. esp Samsung and Apple. Easily lasts for more than 36 hours with continuous 2G, occasional wifi on. 5.The BB10 OS, very fresh, very new, and feels great to have when every other phone out there is an android or iOS 6.Decent camera, have taken some pretty good pics. Good video capture too. Capable of 1080p 7.Very good and LOUD speakers. 8.Great form factor. Feels good and solid in the hand. The back cover offers great grip. No chance of slipping! 9.Best of both worlds: QWERTY + touch 10.Very fast processor. No hang, no freeze, no auto restarts. Everything is a breeze  CONS Really cant think of any. Coz, this phone gives me everything I need from it. Do not buy this phone if your priorities are playing games, watching movies etc. Get this, if what you need is a serious no-nonsense smart phone that you can really depend on, And get a Tab for the rest.

Speculations were ripe that it would be launched with a price tag &#60; 30K, got me excited more so but when I checked the price of UK launch, it was too costly so I kept hanging on to my Curve which I was frustrated with considering that was the first smartphone for me and it really left bad taste in my mouth *but* I did not lose hope on BB. Let me say it clearly, I am not a fan of big screen phone, nor do I care for too many apps. I am sure most of the million apps in IOS or Android are of very little use but that is still a selling point for them. I am happy with whatever BB has to offer and now that BB collaborated with Amazon's Appstore BB users would get most of the apps they were craving for which might not work as expected but none the less they are there.  On the hardware side 8MP camera is good enough but not comparable to Samsung's 13MP or HTC M8 4UP. Typing is very good with the keyboard and enough space b/w the keys. I found typing more comfortable with h/w keyboard than on a touch screen phone. Dual Core from QCOM snapdragon is really fast.

This is the main reason for less battery backup."], ["5.0", "Life is easier with BlackBerry", "Nizamudeen", "First of all, It's a psychological fact; Anyone can use an android smartphone - and that's where it's falling down. Every software should have a status; a standard. Android has failed to create a specific market of users by letting everyone to use it by making it very cheap. Nowadays you can use android even for Rs. 1000/- (but you'll go mad by its worst quality, if you use one)  Now coming to Blackberry, it has never lost its status; it may commercially fail in this hopeless world, but let me repeat, Blackberry WILL NEVER LOSE ITS STATUS. It has it's own potential, specific users.  The reasons why I'm saying this are as follows:  1. BlackBerry is born for Effective communication:  Never ever think of this phone if you're buying a phone primarily for games, watching videos or other entertainment reasons. A mobile phone can provide all these things. But its primary functionality is to communicate. And BlackBerry is the only OS which provides this much seamless and quality communication - of any mode.  a. Phone calls - Voice quality is crystal clear; I wonder how BlackBerry picks up signal even in weak coverage areas.  b. Messages and Emails - This is where BlackBerry stands out of the crowd; And this is the reason you should own a BlackBerry Q10. The way they have organized your mail accounts and messages is like... MAN I don't have any words to say. BlackBerry Algorithm is amazing when comes to the Fully Organized BlackBerry Hub. Life becomes very organized and easier.  c. Social Accounts - Facebook, twitter and other social sites are time wasters if you log in to their main webpage. But when configured these accounts in BlackBerry Hub, it only disturbs you when there is something really important from these sites. Useless video uploads, invites for playing games are time wasters and you can switch them off and spend your time in only important things through customized notifications.  2. Keyboard Typing - All of us know that Blackberry is the only smartphone which provides a physical keyboard. And I want to add that  BlackBerry alone can do that. Androids and Iphones can never bring one. And Typing experience in BlackBerry is breeeeeeeeze.. You won't stop typing if you start. No noise of buttons. Very fast and accurate typing which gives you a tangible feedback. You'll forget those swiping touchscreen keyboards of androids and windows. 100s of shortcuts also.  3. OS and User Interface - I loved the Blackberry OS since it has released it's Version 7 OS. But I was unable to buy one at that time. Blackberry 10.2 OS is really great with its new features. This UI has lot of gestures and its full of swipy. The BlackBerry Peek option is wonderful. Overall the UI is very intuitive.  Only high-status people will prefer blackberry smartphones. That's what everyone think. Let it be. But if this phone comes under your budget, you SHOULD use this smartphone. Seemless communication... Intuitive OS and UI... Amazing Keyboard typing experience.

{"url": "http://www.amazon.in/HTC-M910X-Desire-Eye/dp/B00RN3SAFE", "reviews": [["4.6", "The best Pair of eye from HTC", "Abraham", "This is my quick review  The Desire Eye can take better pictures, and it is water resistant. The battery life is almost as good as on the M8. Go for the Desire Eye. perfect sense. fantastic camera. no overheat no frozen screen.  CAMERA : Probably the best front camera and decent back camera as compared to others. PERFORMANCE : Benchmarks may not be the best.But is smooth even under heavy usage.works great in daily usage. BATTERY LIFE:  Amazing....!! last full day. SCREEN:one of the best displays available.even better than m8 Touch and feel: the sense UI is the answer.  CONS: Gestures are not always handy. hard to open for SIM replacement. no beats audio. plastics body. not so premium as the M8."], ["4.0", "A Real Eye- Opener", "Neal", "Short analysis :  Design : 9/10 Display : 9/10 Software :8/10 Performance : 8/10 Battery Life  6/10 Camera : 7/10 Value for Money : 7/10  IN Depth Review :  Design : In appearance, the Desire Eye is no One M8. It&#8217;s not made from metal and sits in the middle of HTC&#8217;s smartphone portfolio. However, its two-tone plastic finish is far from ugly and it&#8217;s solid and easy to grip. I found the finish to be less tacky than the Galaxy S5 and Note 4. The most peculiar thing about the Desire Eye&#8217;s appearance is its large front-facing camera.  Surprisingly, though, it isn&#8217;t distracting and works well. What&#8217;s also nice is the fact that the phone&#8217;s speakers have been placed cleanly at either end of its display. At first glance, it would seem there aren&#8217;t any at all. But there are, if you look carefully.  Display : The Desire Eye comes packed with a 5.2-inch (1080 x 1920 pixels) display, with a density of 424 pixels per inch (PPI). This is virtually the same as HTC&#8217;s flagship One M8, though that manages a slightly higher pixel density of 441 PPI.  Colors are sharp and wide-ranged, with darks, in particular, standing out. Like the majority of smartphones, though, colors aren&#8217;t as clear when exposed to daylight. However, this isn&#8217;t a major issue, and you can still enjoy your favorite shows and movies while on the go.  Software : The Desire Eye runs Android KitKat with HTC&#8217;s Sense 6 UI atop. Sense has to be one of the simplest Android UIs out there, unlike Samsung&#8217;s TouchWiz, which is cluttered with superfluous animations and functions. Here, there&#8217;s a sense of fluency that makes it easy to use and good to look at.  What&#8217;s particularly useful is the BlinkFeed function. Situated on the phone&#8217;s homescreen, it provides you with a list of content you&#8217;re interested in &#8211; from newspaper reports to social media updates.  Another nifty feature is HTC&#8217;s Do Not Disturb Mode, which lets you disable notifications at certain times of the day. If you&#8217;re an iOS user, you may have noticed that this is the same name as Apple&#8217;s variant. They&#8217;re both good and get the job done.  There&#8217;s full access to the Google Play Store, too, as you&#8217;d expect.  Performance : Sporting a quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor, the Desire Eye is well-equipped. It&#8217;s not up to the standard of the Snapdragon 805, but it&#8217;s still powerful enough to provide you with a smooth performance and can handle demanding games like Asphalt 8. There&#8217;s also 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage on offer, which can be expanded with an additional up to 128GB via the microSD card slot.  The Desire Eye offers up a 2,400mAh battery, which is smaller than the M8&#8217;s by just 200mAh. According to HTC, it has 20 hours of talk time and can last up to 538 hours on stand-by.  Camera : The Desire Eye has two 13-megapixel cameras &#8211; one on the front and one on the back. There&#8217;s also a dual-LED flash on the front, which means you get to take selfies in the day as well as at night. The only thing different with the front-facer is that it has a smaller aperture. Thanks to a dedicated shutter button, you won&#8217;t have a problem taking photos, and there&#8217;s a fast shutter speed. You won&#8217;t be disappointed with the overall quality, either, as photos look sharp and colorful. What is worth noting, however, is that images taken in the dark lack detail slightly, and the dual-LED can make photos look washed out. This isn&#8217;t a problem you get with the iPhone&#8217;s dual-LED rear flash, but there isn&#8217;t a flash on the front.  Verdict : This is one of the most selfie-obsessed smartphones out there, so if you&#8217;re vain, you needn&#8217;t look any further.  If you&#8217;re not into your selfies, you may find it inconvenient to have a huge front-facing camera slapped in front of you. That said, the Desire Eye is certainly capable as an all-rounder, with an elegant and strong design, a fast processor and a battery that can get you through the day."], ["5.0", "1 smart phone is", "prasannakumar.s", "NO.1 smart phone is.

How one could get all this at this price on this date. I've got my answer. Either the product has nothing do about &/or the manufacturer has nothing to care about - reliability and professionalism in product(s).  In simple words, you get the product and most of the technical features in it but, suddenly if your phone slips of sweaty hands at say crowded streets or train station, you probably have to pick 3 pieces of your phone: battery, back cover and and the main phone part. No it would hardly break but dissembles no matter how tight you fix back cover. You don't expect this kind of things, either they use to break or they won't break.  Inside you'll find 2 for sims and 1 microSD card slot. The setup is so cramped and weird that there is fair chance that you may need to open back cover and reposition the sim card sometimes, because the sim cards might slip a bit due to shocks and won't work. But, the microSD card slot was the worst. I have never found any device that doesnot &#34;click-lock&#34; to avoid slip and dropping off of this very important SD card memory. But this device was having the same slip sim card style slot. Who was the jerk who designed it and who approved it too??  When you turn on the phone, the internal software and OS was working good and fast and 512 MB was not found to be any issue. Battery lasted a day, no heating on charging.  However, the picture and videos can be viewed clear and good only if the picture or video is of good resolution and good picture quality, otherwise may look worse.  The lowest brightness of phone is too high, can't work on the phone at low or no lights, the brightness hits on eyes. Not good to work on this phone in dark.  I didnot yet mentioned the Manufacturing DEFECT in THIS Phone. The microSD memory card slot was NOT Working. I had to return this product due to that. (Thank God!)  Earlier few months ago I have had bought Unlocked Internet data card E303 of Huawei and in that I couldn't recognize that the 3G Wifi Hotspot feature was not working. After a month I found it but it wasnot that important to me, so I disregarded it and still bought this phone. Well! That was a bad idea.  I donot recommend this product. I donot recommend Huawei products unless you have worked &/or used one already, better buy the same model. If you still buy, test it thoroughly within 5 days and return immediately if found any defect.  Or choose other options especially those companies whose Headquarters NOT located in Shenzhen, China. Since, as per my personal analysis, companies from that area &#34;usually&#34; are &#34;amateurishly managed&#34; and so do their &#34;products are unreliable&#34;, including software products too.

Since this is build on Google's reference design, all these devices have the same internal specs, only the outward looks change.  What's in the Box : Phone,Battery,Screen Guard,Charger,Headphones (Not in-ear )  Display : IPS Display with Good viewing angles and is pleasing to Look at even though the PPI is low. No Complains.  Looks and Build Quality : The back panel is not matte finished, rather it has a smooth panel and is not that grippy. The front of the device is almost identical to other First Gen Android One devices. Build quality is OK for the price. The phone is quite heavy which is surprising as it only has a small 1700mAh battery inside.  Software and Performance : This comes with Android 4.4.4 out of the box and is expected to get Android L update by the end of January. Google is promising 2 Years of Software support which is great for the price. Overall performance of the device is good, hardly saw any lags while Multitasking. Mediatek Mt6582 quadcore performs quite well and you can play many popular games without any issues.  Camera : Both Cameras are just Average, nothing to get excited about.  Battery: This only has a 1700mAh Battery, which won't last a Full day of use if you use Internet often. This is, in my opinion the biggest issue with these AndroidOne devices. To get better backup from this small battery, Use ART Runtime ( Google Search to know how to Switch to ART from Dalvik ). Hopefully, we can expect further Battery improvements in the upcoming Android L OTA for this device.  Storage : 4GB internal. Around 2.5GB Available. You cannot choose default app install location as the sdcard, but you can Move supported apps to Sdcard. OTG is not Supported.  Verdict : I bought this solely for the 2 year Software support from Google. If you don't care about updates, you can get better devices under 10K range in India now. If you have access to a charging port always,like a laptop or a pc, the small Battery is not that big a concern.Next gen AndroidOne devices are coming First Quarter of 2015,with better specs and hopefully a bigger battery.I would recommend waiting for those if smaller battery and a low resolution display is an issue for you."], ["4.0", "Four Stars", "chirag kandpal", "great phone but battery life should have been better"], ["5.0", "Best at 5k", "Mani Harsha", "this is my first order in amazon,very good packing and delivery is also good coming to the phone its simply woww who gives u full hd recording at 5k and 1 gigs of ram and its google too go for !!!!t"], ["5.0", "awesome phone !!!", "Omkar Dhole", "Class phone by karbonn Con's... 1.Software update promise broken by google 2.battery not last 1 days Pros 1.camera good 2.best internal storage and apps movable to SD card. 3.present all sensors 4.auto brightness available"], ["4.0", "Four Stars", "Suresh", "really good and affordable phone.

Awesome !!", "mac", "First of all,the HTC One look alike image uploaded on this by Amazon as a product image is FAKE. I have uploaded the real M2 images in product images section.  # Main Highlights 1) 4200mAh Battery - Can easily last 2 days of very heavy usage. 2) Quadcore - Mtk6582M processor 3) 1 GB Ram 4) Android 4.2 Jellybean.  4200mAh battery is unheard in a device shipping at this price range. The other 2 handsets that ships with similar battery are Lenovo P780 and Xolo Q3000,but both are priced much higher than this. Due to the huge battery it needs to accommodate,the device is bulky, and a little heavier than other smartphones. The display is a 5 inch one with a resolution of 480 x 854 pixels,which is not that great,but OK. The viewing angles are also not that great. The processor/gpu combination is powerful enough to play many of the games without much issues and the jellybean on board runs smooth. Gionee has opted to ship this with a custom UI instead of Android stock UI.  # Some Misc Info This is a dual sim phone - One is the normal sim slot, while the other is a micro sim slot. OTG is not supported Sensors on board - Accelerometer,Magnetic Sensor,Light Sensor,Proximity Sensor,Orientation sensors. Capacitive buttons are not back-lighted always.  # Camera Impressive for the price. 8MP rear camera takes good pictures.

Review follows:  Pros: Display is nice. Best Touch response. Quad core processor loaded with Android 4.4.2 performing well for many purpose. 512MB RAM doing better job equivalent to 1GB RAM Mobiles. 4\" screen which is suitable for me to carry and keep easily. Voice clarity is good for the call. Better high end gaming experience, this phone is based on TN (Best touch response) screen. HD video recording with good quality. Shoot photo while HD video recording which is one of the great future. Seeing a movie or video songs in this mobile is really a fantastic. Less SAR value: 0.48 W/kg @ Head and 0.46 W/kg @ Body. SIM 1(3G): I have activated 3G internet pack, enabled data usage. Internet access is super fast with 3G(3,H,H+) network, download speed is realy great, 7MBps, youtube streaming video and other high quality online streaming video played well. SIM 1 has option to choose network such as 3G preferred,  3G only, 2G only. Made in India  Cons: External output volume is less for 2.1 or 5.1channel connection via 3.5mm jack. SIM2(2G): I have activated 3G internet pack, enabled data usage. But sim2 connect to 2G(E) network only for net access which is slow net access (120KBps) SIM2 does not had any option to choose the network, I hope SIM2 supports only 2G which is missing in the spec.  Conclusion: Call quality is nice. Video and photo quality is fine for me. One of the best future is taking photo while video recording*****. The phone is great if they used energy efficient chipset to good battery life and sim2 with 3G network.

I already own a Galaxy S4 and my review about the product is mainly the comparison between the two. I am not biased toward any one of these. Both have their own pros and cons. I will take it up one by one on most desired characteristics of a phone for an average user.  1. Media/ Codec support: This is one of the most desired features for me. I use my phone mostly for checking mails and media. As per my experience, Galaxy S4 is better than iPhone 5. You can play almost anything on S4 but on iPhone 5 you need to have good paid apps to get the job done. This round goes to S4.  2. Transferring content: Transferring content on iPhone 5 is not easy. You need to have either wifi or iTunes to get your job done. This is not the case with Galaxy S4. You can transfer content the way you want(fast USB transfer). Since I use linux for my day to day activities, I prefer to use galaxy S4 as my media consumption device. Since iTunes doesn't exist for linux, I have to rely on wifi to transfer my content to iPhone which is cumbersome. This round goes to Galaxy S4.  3. Battery: When it comes to battery life, iPhone 5 is a monster. I get more than a day on a full recharge. With galaxy S4 I had to do a lot of tricks to get better battery life. More you install the apps on your android, lesser will be the battery life. This is not the case with any iOS device. This round goes to iPhone 5.  4. Internal memory: With iPhone 5 I got around 13 GB and with galaxy S4 I got around 9 GB free internal storage. I have filled my iPhone upto 12.5 GB and I didnot feel even 5% degradation in performance. Device still runs smooth and there is no change in battery life. My galaxy S4 has about 5 GB filled with apps, games and music and I see a huge degradation in performance. I am wondering if I would install more apps and games, the performance would go down further by 30-40%. Also after installing a 64GB class 10 ext SD card, S4 has become further slow and I see stutters and lag while navigating across UI. This round goes to iPhone 5.  5. User Experience/Speed/Response time: I would say iPhone 5 is a definite winner in this case. All apps and games run very fast and response for any action is very quick. Android is open source and extremely customizable but all of this comes at a price of performance. Galaxy S4 is fast but not as fast as iPhone 5. Galaxy S4 contains a lots of features but most of them are useless. Also lock screen of Galaxy S4 is extremely slow. Sometimes it take 3-4 sec to turn S4 lock screen on after pressing the power button. This annoys me a lot. This round goes to iPhone 5.  6. Gaming: Games run smoother on iPhone than my Galaxy S4. Difference is clearly noticeable when you play heavy games. Obviously it is not noticeable when playing small games. iPhone 5 wins this one.  7. Customization: No doubt Android wins this round. iOS has almost no customization. But I really don't care much about this. Widgets are almost useless to me as they get refreshed after 1-2 sec of moving to the window they belong to. Rooting a device is another benefit with Android as there are lot many custom roms available. But I really dont have much time to do all these. This one goes to Galaxy S4.  8. Media Streaming(From Video streaming websites): You will not be able to play content from lot many websites on an iOS device. And streaming will be slower compared to Android on many other websites. This round goes to Galaxy S4. Definitely there is a very fast Youtube app for iOS device but I stream videos from many other websites for which there is no app. This makes my S4 as the primary media streaming device.  9. Ecosystem/Apps: iOS has the more polished, faster and better quality apps. Apps have beautiful interface and they are faster too because they run natively and not on top of any dalvik VM as in Android. Because things have to run on top of a dalvik VM in android, it can never become faster than iOS. This one goes to iPhone 5.  10. Looks and usability: No doubt iPhone 5 looks way better than Galaxy S4. Also when it comes to UI, iOS UI is way better looking than Android. In terms of usability, I prefer iPhone 5. Because it has just the perfect size. I prefer to use my phone with 1 hand. iPhone 5 is just perfect when you want to use a phone on the go. IPhone 5 is the perfect size for daily use and fits nicely in pocket. But smaller screen is not very good for media consumption. This round goes to iPhone 5.  11. Hardware: Definitely iOS devices have more powerful hardware. Also material used is much better in iPhone 5. This round goes to iPhone 5.  Please note that I don't favour any of these platforms specifically and I am not biased to any specific platform. I use my Galaxy S4 for Media consumption and iPhone for gaming, browsing, reading, news and chat. As you can see all have their advantages and disadvantages but I prefer iPhone 5 over my Galaxy S4 for day to day activities."], ["5.0", "Very reliable phone and bug free OS", "Kiran K.

The looks of the phone is good. but like any other budget device,this too come with a lot of flaws. I would strongly recommend you to buy a better quadcore 1GB ram device around Rs 10000 than settling for this device.  Some notable issues 1) 1.3 GHz Dual Core Processor and Only 512 MB Ram - if you are gonna use this phone for just a few apps like Whatsapp,Facebook etc,you may find this combination sufficient. Not suitable for high end gaming,but can play some basic games though.Expect lags often while multitasking. 2) Camera quality is just below average and its a fixed focus one. Without auto focus,its hard to get good blur free images. 3) Battery backup can be an issue as it only packs a 1400mAh battery. 4) Back cover lacks grip - slippery.

I already own a Galaxy S4 and my review about the product is mainly the comparison between the two. I am not biased toward any one of these. Both have their own pros and cons. I will take it up one by one on most desired characteristics of a phone for an average user.  1. Media/ Codec support: This is one of the most desired features for me. I use my phone mostly for checking mails and media. As per my experience, Galaxy S4 is better than iPhone 5. You can play almost anything on S4 but on iPhone 5 you need to have good paid apps to get the job done. This round goes to S4.  2. Transferring content: Transferring content on iPhone 5 is not easy. You need to have either wifi or iTunes to get your job done. This is not the case with Galaxy S4. You can transfer content the way you want(fast USB transfer). Since I use linux for my day to day activities, I prefer to use galaxy S4 as my media consumption device. Since iTunes doesn't exist for linux, I have to rely on wifi to transfer my content to iPhone which is cumbersome. This round goes to Galaxy S4.  3. Battery: When it comes to battery life, iPhone 5 is a monster. I get more than a day on a full recharge. With galaxy S4 I had to do a lot of tricks to get better battery life. More you install the apps on your android, lesser will be the battery life. This is not the case with any iOS device. This round goes to iPhone 5.  4. Internal memory: With iPhone 5 I got around 13 GB and with galaxy S4 I got around 9 GB free internal storage. I have filled my iPhone upto 12.5 GB and I didnot feel even 5% degradation in performance. Device still runs smooth and there is no change in battery life. My galaxy S4 has about 5 GB filled with apps, games and music and I see a huge degradation in performance. I am wondering if I would install more apps and games, the performance would go down further by 30-40%. Also after installing a 64GB class 10 ext SD card, S4 has become further slow and I see stutters and lag while navigating across UI. This round goes to iPhone 5.  5. User Experience/Speed/Response time: I would say iPhone 5 is a definite winner in this case. All apps and games run very fast and response for any action is very quick. Android is open source and extremely customizable but all of this comes at a price of performance. Galaxy S4 is fast but not as fast as iPhone 5. Galaxy S4 contains a lots of features but most of them are useless. Also lock screen of Galaxy S4 is extremely slow. Sometimes it take 3-4 sec to turn S4 lock screen on after pressing the power button. This annoys me a lot. This round goes to iPhone 5.  6. Gaming: Games run smoother on iPhone than my Galaxy S4. Difference is clearly noticeable when you play heavy games. Obviously it is not noticeable when playing small games. iPhone 5 wins this one.  7. Customization: No doubt Android wins this round. iOS has almost no customization. But I really don't care much about this. Widgets are almost useless to me as they get refreshed after 1-2 sec of moving to the window they belong to. Rooting a device is another benefit with Android as there are lot many custom roms available. But I really dont have much time to do all these. This one goes to Galaxy S4.  8.

I can start by saying that before buying, I was very skeptical about the product. The company is new in Inidan market and is the sub-brand of another low cost cell manufacturer. I tried to do some online research & review and initial feedback was superb for Q800, then I got a chace to speak with a mobile repairing shop and overall feedback about the company was not good at all. I go ahead with the purchase because I'm not a very tech savvy and thought of using a low cost phones before buying a good one. After the 2 months use I'm &#34;almost&#34; satisfied with the product and is not thinking of another brand new cell (atleast for now). Now coming to details of the product  PROS: 1.

Sound is not great, but nothing to complain for too (as you can expect that it won't be the ebst in any way) 6. The sensors working fine 7. the box comes with an additional screen guard, which is really handy  CONS: 1. I'll start with battery. As for all other low cost brands, it's battery is also not  good. It doesn't run for more than 18-20 hours (I'm medium - heavy user and prefer to charge once it goes beow 20%) 2. Screen doesn't work best under sunlight (unless I make it as most bright) 3. GPS takes long time to lock (if not more than a minute, very close to it) 4. Radio has a problem, few cases experience worst - no sound 5. There is no way to close all the running program simultaneously, you have to do it one by one  Suggestion: Please go for this product if you 1.

Checked all the gionee phone including this one. Sharing my views regarding this phone - Pros: (SOUND) 1. This phone have 2 speakers on back side (Yamaha). Sound quality of speaker is just awesome. Never found such android phone with that much of sound. Pretty cool thing battery drainage is also less. (LOOK & FEEL) 2. Look and feel like high end HTC phones. Top and bottom side have metallic finish. Only thing I didnt like is the gionee logo at the back side. This logo is good in other phones. Still different people different choice. (CAMERA) 3. Never doubt Gionee camera. It is always awesome. Do not know which sensor they used but 8MP rear is awesome. Taken some pictures on low light at showroom. This is same as Sony Xperia ZL series (My brother have this phone). Now the front cam is best for video callings (as I told dont doubt gionee camera). (UI) 4. This phone have preloaded Android Kitkat. Gionee UI is almost same as XIAMI, HUAWEI. I can see all the Chinese mobile companies are using almost same software(Customized Android). Only look and feel will be different. 5. This phone come with a back cover and it feel premium (One customer bought it and I checked). It also comes with 2 screen guard. 6. Almost 460 RAM is empty. Good thing that in gionee phone you can remove preloaded apps. Only 2 apps cant be removed one is the security soft another I forgot :)  7. I checked the showroom prices and it was 13990 last day.

I got the same online for a sale at 28k. The phone was a flagship previously and hence is an excellent phone, it has since been overtaken by other flagships from HTC but manages to hold its ground pretty well. If you are looking for a dual sim phone which has CDMA as well as GSM then this phone, along with HTC one E8 are good bets. This phone lacks the 4G option, so those looking for the same should look at other options.  Built quality The built quality of this phone is too good. The metal body gives a very regal look and feel. The phone also feels very sturdy. They have given a small removable cover for the insertion of the microsim and the micro SD cards. This is very good as it is a comfortable arrangement rather than small flap for insertion of sims.  Display The display is 4.7 inches big. It is perfect for daily use when compared to some of the 5+ inch mobiles on offer today. This can just be operated on one hand but we have to be careful as the power button is on the top and little awkward to reach. The display is sharp and crisp with good color reproduction and viewing angles.  Call quality The call quality is top notch. The clarity of voice received by us and also the user on other end is very good. There is always good reception which helps a lot.  Sound quality HTC mobiles are renowned for their sound quality, and the HTC one dual sim does not disappoint. Great clarity from the speakers and great for listening to music/ watching movies.  Touch response The touch response is buttery smooth. And gives a good user experience.  Ease of use The phone is relative easy to use. Some features like blinkfeed may not be liked by everyone so may be enabled or disabled as deemed fit. The built in HTC diagnostics are also good for shecking for hardware problems. There is no bloat-ware as such  Camera The camera leaves something more to be desired. The quality of the shots are good, but going for &#8220;4 ultra-pixel&#8221; is a gamble which HTC took but failed at. Recent models have replaced this with higher &#8220;megapixel&#8221; ratings. If you want an excellent camera you may want to steer clear.  Performance The overall performance of the mobile is good. The capable processor with the high RAM runs any application with ease. Multiple applications also do not affect the performance much. Gaming is also smooth as is browsing and other routine applications.  Power consumption Power consumption used to be a problem with the battery draining fast.

PROS: The looks are impressive, especially with the black variety. The features too are nothing mediocre - 512 MB RAM, 1 GHz processor, 3G, GPS, accelerometer and Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean). The sound quality of music playback is great. Plays videos upto 720p without a problem. I haven't tried higher resolutions.  CONS: But the compromise that has been made with screen quality and camera to keep price low, does show off obtrusively. The screen quality isn't very bad, just that the viewing angles aren't great, but still is satisfactory as long as you don't place it side by side with a Samsung Duos or an LG Optimus. The camera works fine in day light, but is poor when used in an ill-lit environment.  USAGE: Apart from these two compromises, there haven't been any problems with the phone like hanging or slow down in the past 1 week since I bought this phone from a local dealer. But I must say I am not a heavy user, and I haven't played heavy games on the mobile.  If all you want is a simple, reliable and sturdy smartphone to browse smoothly through websites, to listen to music, play a few games, watch some videos now and then, make use of the android platform for its myriads of apps, and if you can trade off with the mediocre screen quality and camera, and if you are trying to upgrade from a basic mobile to a smartphone, you will be satisfied with this phone. The phone is cheaper online than in most retail stores.

Charged 40% in one hour. I wanted loud phone  sound to use Google translate and it is loud and clear.  Ok sound to listen to music or movie while traveling. No bass, but enjoyable to hear. When I travel this will replace my Macbook which now seems very heavy Movies are good with headphones. Build is solid. The back plastic feels like metal, not soft and is not slippery. Kit Kat upgrade went smoothly. Worth the price and I have recently seen it even lower, look around. Not too big in my hand or pocket, except for one pair of shorts. Might be too big for a small hand. I would rather have this phone and the money difference then a Iphone 6. Cons.  Screen could be brighter.

Lenovo has created a marvelous phone, it is very fast, never hanged in 2 days, camera is decent and looks are good.  Only thing where Lonovo has made a mistake (and a big mistake I would say since they marred the joy of otherwise an excellent phone) is they saved money on the back lid/cover of the phone. It is such a cheap quality plastic that I was afraid of breaking it when I was opening it the first time to fit battery inside. Why save 50 rs. on the back-lid when you invested so much on the rest of the phone. Does Lenovo realize that the number of little locks they have added to the cheap plastic back-lid, even if 1 of them breaks, the back-lid will be loose forever. No one can fix it then. Do you guys sell back covers in the market? How to get it if it break? Is any Lonovo staff member listening?

Lots of sensors some of which are quite useful if you don't use flip cover. Quality of parts do not match expensive brands probably because it is not expensive like them (obviously). Overall, it's been running pretty smooth for a month now. I have to mention about its sleekness again, it's so super light and so slim.

All the numbers listed on their site[...]are out-dated. I have a Micromax A78. And this is a general review. The phones are great for their price range. But, your problems start after a year, when small parts of your mobile start failing and you have to sell your soul to the demons to get the spare parts. And you have to pay the exorbitant prices quoted by your local mobile shop dealer because there is no other source you can compare these prices to.  If you are looking for a reliable long lasting smart phone, Micromax is not advisable. This is not my personal opinion, as I had the rare fortune of visiting a service center in Bangalore early this year and I talked to at least a dozen people who had to pay the whole amount as their guarantee period had just ended. The center is not servicing for micromax anymore.  Other than that, the battery lasts a good 6-8 hours depending on the amount of usage. The processor is a bit slow for my requirement, but given the price range, it is decent enough. It is strongly built (I have dropped it 2-3 times already!). I have had to replace the charging pin, battery."], ["5.0", "buy from amazon at great price", "yogesh tyagi", "First android ...got no problems using since a year"], ["4.0", "Very Good VFM phone with few cons", "hemant", "I'll talk about the cons first because they are really annoying me right now.  1) Viewing angles are good sideways, but very bad from top and bottom. So if you are playing games in landscape orientation, then it will cause you headaches as the screen gets blackened with slightest of tilt.  2) Cameras, both, are nothing but jokes. No other words.  3) Headphones which look impressive don't sound that well. But maybe they are new and I should run them in burn-in period for around 100 hours and then their quality might improve. It's not a con actually but I felt it was worth mentioning.  That's it with the cons. There are plenty of good things and I'll not highlight them in points form but in paragraph style because there's plenty to write about.  The main highlight of this phone is the design which is just fantastic. The build quality looks premium and you'll feel very nice to hold this phone in your hands. Because of the impressive design, the phone feels a lot slimmer than it actually is. Nice job by MMX in this department. My phone doesn't heat that much as mentioned by other reviewers. Design, build quality and hardware, all are pretty solid.  Hardware pretty impressive for a budget phone. Specs are, 1.3 ghz dual core and not 1.2 ghz as mentioned. FWVGA 5 inch screen with 5 point multitouch, pretty good loudspeaker and crisp clear sound, RAM 512 MB and free ram around 230 mb which is excellent I must say.  The screen is sharp and vivid, though the resolution is low and bad viewing angles, it is smooth and touch response is just perfect. The colours are 16.7 millions, while you'll get at the most 262k colours in similar budget phones.  As mentioned earlier, lots of high graphics games are supported and all the basic games and apps have no issues at all. High graphic games like N.O.V.A. 3, Modern Combat 4, Asphalt 7 & 8, Real Racing 3 and even FIFA 2014 run pretty good and I am impressed with the performance. No problems with apps and performance, whatever works does work very well without any issues. Internal memory for apps is more than 1 gb so no need to worry about internal memory and no need to move apps to sdcard also. Game data is stored on external micro sdcard so that's EXCELLENT and worth mentioning.  Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2, butter smooth. Latest version is there so we need not worry about latest os and all.  HD and Full HD videos are supported in Hardware mode in MX player. Internet speed is good in all modes, eg. wifi, 3g and even 2g. Comes with two screen guards out of which one is already applied on phone. Funny thing, mine which was already applied on the phone went off while I tried to remove protective film so had to use other screen guard.  When compared to its sibling Canvas Fun A74, it is a much better deal because, 1) A74 Screen size is 4.5 inch, A76 is 5 incher 2) A74 supports 3 finger multitouch, A76 has 5 finger multitouch 3) Battery of A74 is 1500 mah, A76 has 2000 mah Rest all the things are same  Nenamark 2 score is 40 fps, Antutu is 9600, Quadrant is 3900  This is my 7th android phone in past 4 years and I am pretty much happy with it. And I'd suggest you all to buy this instead of other brand phones in similar budget as the services of MMX have really improved now-a-days, while I'm fed up with after sales services from brands like Karbonn, Xolo and even Samsung."], ["4.0", "Four Stars", "prakash rabha", "Mmex cnvas a76 is very gud."]], "title": "Micromax Canvas Fun A76 (Blue)"}

Wont recognize anything unless in broad daylight. Battery - Even with stamina mode, latest software updates, low brightness, no auto updates, no continuous internet and moderate usage - I have to charge my phone every night.

After reading some reviews in GSM arena I expected around 1.5 days atleast when the phone is new. Speaker Volume is low. To avoid radiation I try using the speaker most often but not with this phone.  Serious issues Internal memory - with not many apps and 1-2 games the internal storage comes as zero quite frequently. After this most of my apps don't work. The only solution is to clear internal storage memory. After which I get back 4gb of internal memory. This way i lose some installed apps and most app data.

The other 2 handsets that ships with similar battery are Lenovo P780 and Xolo Q3000,but both are priced much higher than this. Due to the huge battery it needs to accommodate,the device is bulky, and a little heavier than other smartphones. The display is a 5 inch one with a resolution of 480 x 854 pixels,which is not that great,but OK. The viewing angles are also not that great. The processor/gpu combination is powerful enough to play many of the games without much issues and the jellybean on board runs smooth. Gionee has opted to ship this with a custom UI instead of Android stock UI.  # Some Misc Info This is a dual sim phone - One is the normal sim slot, while the other is a micro sim slot.

{"url": "http://www.amazon.in/HTC-One-M8-Glacial-Silver/dp/B00KDD6RLK", "reviews": [["4.1", "The one for you? Lets see.", "Kanwar Anand", "A drawback of getting the iPhone 6 is that it is very slippery, I mean it is virtually unusable without a case since it keeps slipping from my hand. I own both phones. The HTC One M8 is the &#34;Snappiest&#34; experience when looking to zip through something, I love Htc Sense UI and have always preferred it over other Androids since its really less cluttered, I've disabled blinkfeed. There are some features that this phone offers that make me like it a lot, Im going to enlist them now and then what I don't like too much,  Features/ Pros - 1) The screen is a delight to look at and if you were to ever take a video while driving (or being driven) through fields and hills, this phone can be pretty good for shooting videos. 2) It takes very long to completely charge and the charging is slow but you know what that means right? The battery life is very very good. In comparison with the iPhone 6, i found both phones last me a day at the very least with normal usage. 3) The Boom sound speakers are good, notice I didn't say great, why? The sound can be too obtrusive at times and maybe a tad hollow. Yes its louder than the iPhone 6 but the iPhone 6 for some reason sounds crisp to me and almost as loud. If you are the kind of person who pays a lot of attention to voice and lyrics, the one m8 doesn't really shine through and needs a touch of refinement. 4) Comes with a case of acceptable quality, a little silicone case 5) The interface is very very fast and watching youtube videos on this is a pleasure especially when you are trying to hear someone &#34;speak&#34; [not sing] 6) Call quality is amazing. I've used other htc's in the past and that was thing I hated about all of them. The call quality, I never understood how they couldn't get such a simple thing right but now that HTC has finally made the loud speaker, the microphone and everything else so responsive, I cant complain anymore 7) Future proof but where is lollipop? :( 8) Build quality is supreme and maybe the best out there despite being almost a year old  Cons/Areas where they could improve - 1) It could charge faster 2) In the interface there is some confusion over power save and brightness, I wish they would do away with it. 3) Sometimes the browser opens and the page isn't instantly customized 4) Bad keyboard typing experience, takes time to get used to 5) Irritating ring tones and vibration patters by default 6) The main camera is below-industry-average and should be bigger brighter and not over-saturate certain reds and greens halos.  Yes, I am nitpicking but why shouldnt i? You're spending a lot of money on this phone so why not.  This makes the best choice over the androids because of build quality, call quality, battery life, beautiful interface and excellent availibility of apps.  I PREFER THIS OVER SAMSUNGS TOUCHWIZ because there is less clutter and it is easier to adapt to.  Excellent multimedia experience overall make this is a worthy purchase."], ["5.0", "Awesome device", "vish", "Device is fantastic no doubt using it second time , first one was bought on launch date and it was gray , I wanted silver but went with whatever was available that time, after 6 mo sold it and bought silver now in GOSF and it was a nice deal."], ["5.0", "Five Stars", "Raju Singh", "Great Phone, prompt delivery"], ["4.0", "Four Stars", "avez mohidin", "Looks great.

The phones are made to an exacting specification laid down by Google, and there are currently three companies in India supplying the phones, viz. Karbonn, Micromax and Spice.  I have already purchased two of the Micromax Android One phones, and now I am the proud owner of the Karbonn model.  The specification of all three phones is identical, and the only difference between the Karbonn and Micromax is the logo and the escutcheon around the rear camera.  I prefer the Karbonn.  This red model is identical to the black, except the removable back is a shocking bright red... I wanted this so that I could easliy tell my phones apart, and boy, does this fluorescent red do the trick!  The specification of the phone is top notch, and I have never had any lag, delay, crashing or any other technical issue with the phone.  A 32 GB SD card can be added (the phone came supplied with an 8 GB card - it needs a memory card or the camera will not save photos) which makes it an excellent choice as a music player or for watching movies if you don't have a TV.  Satellite Navigation, GPS, Skype, Apps, everything works perfectly, and this phone is definitely worth buying even at double the price."], ["4.0", "Karbonn Sparkle V - Good Performance,and 2 years Software support, but a smaller battery can be an issue for many.", "mac", "Karbonn Sparkle V is an Android One device released along with other AndroidOne devices from Spice and Micromax. Since this is build on Google's reference design, all these devices have the same internal specs, only the outward looks change.  What's in the Box : Phone,Battery,Screen Guard,Charger,Headphones (Not in-ear )  Display : IPS Display with Good viewing angles and is pleasing to Look at even though the PPI is low. No Complains.  Looks and Build Quality : The back panel is not matte finished, rather it has a smooth panel and is not that grippy. The front of the device is almost identical to other First Gen Android One devices. Build quality is OK for the price. The phone is quite heavy which is surprising as it only has a small 1700mAh battery inside.  Software and Performance : This comes with Android 4.4.4 out of the box and is expected to get Android L update by the end of January. Google is promising 2 Years of Software support which is great for the price. Overall performance of the device is good, hardly saw any lags while Multitasking. Mediatek Mt6582 quadcore performs quite well and you can play many popular games without any issues.  Camera : Both Cameras are just Average, nothing to get excited about.  Battery: This only has a 1700mAh Battery, which won't last a Full day of use if you use Internet often. This is, in my opinion the biggest issue with these AndroidOne devices. To get better backup from this small battery, Use ART Runtime ( Google Search to know how to Switch to ART from Dalvik ). Hopefully, we can expect further Battery improvements in the upcoming Android L OTA for this device.  Storage : 4GB internal. Around 2.5GB Available. You cannot choose default app install location as the sdcard, but you can Move supported apps to Sdcard. OTG is not Supported.  Verdict : I bought this solely for the 2 year Software support from Google. If you don't care about updates, you can get better devices under 10K range in India now. If you have access to a charging port always,like a laptop or a pc, the small Battery is not that big a concern.Next gen AndroidOne devices are coming First Quarter of 2015,with better specs and hopefully a bigger battery.I would recommend waiting for those if smaller battery and a low resolution display is an issue for you."], ["2.0", "Before buying this phone please read my review.And I am not crying for that Lollipop update!!!", "Divyesh Bansal", "Cons:If you are reading this review that means that you are planning to buy this phone.A normal person will buy this phone because it is from google so its build quality will be good.I am using the phone since october,and i dont find anything that a google phone has.you wont believe but when I play asphalt 8 on this phone,it gets heated as someone has put it on fire.Heating issues are not only while playing heavy games,it also gets heated if you talk for long hours.Battery backup is also an issue,only 5 to 6 hours after fully charged.  Pros:This phone has a very good scope of development,if you will install custom roms on the device it is a very nice device in that aspect.Also it never hangs.Camera is also good.

I hate Touch wiz so no to Samsung. Z2, Z3 & M8 were way costly for me. I was looking for phone with decent in size with full HD screen & powerful SOC. 5 inch screen with full HD resolution is kind of sweet spot. One plus one was not available in India during October 2014 it was coming on Amazon in December 2014 but I didn't wanted to wait that long. So my options in Oct 2014 were E8, Moto X 2014, S5, Lenovo Vibe Z2 pro & Oppo Find 7. Considering the Size, weight, Aesthetics, Screen size & resolution, Boom Sound, 128 GB Expandable & most Imp of all 'Dual Sim' I decided to go with E8. Grey color looked very dull, Red attracts lot of attention so Bought White. Bought it from T*e Mo***e St**e, for 32k. Also bought Amazer TPU Case from Amazon for 549. I will review the case at the end. I have been using this phone for past 5 months now. I am not exaggerating this review.  Lot of you guys already knows the specifications of E8. I would like to share some Actual Specifications. 1)Processor is Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 @ 2.46 GHz, 4 Cores 2)Mother board is MSM8974 (not MSM8975AC) 3)Architecture Krait 400 4)Process 28nm 5)Gpu Renderer Adreno 330 @ 578 MHz 6)Kernel Architecture armv7l 7)Screen Size is 4.92 inches 8)Screen Resolution is 1920x1080 9)Total Ram available 1823 MB (1.82 GB) LPDDR3 10)Available Storage 10.43GB out of 16GB 11)Battery is Lithium Polymer with 2600 mAh Capacity 12)Sensors are Accelerometer, Magnetic field Sensor, Gyroscope, CM36282 Light & Proximity Sensor, Compass, CWGD Orientation Sensor (Source AnTuTu & Cpu-Z)  The Good- 1)Very Fast, Flawless Performance. 2)Opening Apps & Multitasking is smooth & fast. 3)Good Battery Life. Lasts one or one n half day easily on moderate usages. 4)Handy power saving modes. 5)Sleek and light weight. 6)Good UI (Sense 6) compared to Samsung&#8217;s Touch-wiz. 7)Heavy games run without lag on max settings (Tested - Asphalt 8, Dead Trigger 2 & Real Racing 3) 8)Boom Sound &#8211; Best speakers on the market on any Mobile till date. 9)Gorgeous Screen. 10)DLNA works Awesome. (Connected to LG smart LED TV worked flawlessly) I was able to share my mobile screen with ZERO lag. Played games on mobile but watching on TV. 11)Comes with android 4.4.2 and with promised updates from HTC till 2 years from product launch. (Expected Lollipop update in Q2 2015.) 12)It&#8217;s A Premium phone with Dual Sim. (no other phone in this category comes with Dual Sim) 13)Smart gestures works fine. No problems encountered. 14)Camera has option to save custom camera settings and Manual mode which works really great. 15)Slow-motion videos comes out awesome. 16)Very good photo editing settings built in with good set of filters and customizations. 17)Supports USB OTG fine, checked with 4GB pen drive with OTG cable, also connected 8GB dual pen drive which worked fine. (Needs File manager App) 18)Good SAR ratings. 19)Headphones comes with phone are of good quality, Sounds excellent with Poweramp with little tweaking. 20)New charger will be available soon with Quick Charge 2.0 technology (Charging 60% in 30 minutes)  The Bad - 1)No file manager to transfer data from SD card to phone memory or to USB OTG. (Will have to install third party File manager apps from play store.) 2)No Equalizer in HTC Music App. 3)Lollipop update shall come with M8 but now looks like it will come in Q2 2015. 4)Less LTE Spectrum bands supported for Indian version compared to competition. 5)Non removable battery. 6)Slow charger, 1 mAH which takes three hours to charge battery from 5% to 100%. 7)Wi-Fi hotspot doesn't work properly for file transfer (Works well with Xender, C share app). Data Network Sharing (3G/2G) works fine on other devices. 8)Due to Glossy finish phone attracts lot of Dust & Fingerprints also gets scratched easily. 9)Only two colored notification LED, not multi colored like Nexus devices. 10)The ear-buds (Red colored) comes with headset doesn't give good fit. I have tried all sizes. Now I have put Sony earbuds.  The Ugly- 1)Camera Auto white balance sucks big times & it&#8217;s not that wide. 2)No optical image stabilizer nor the 2k or 4k video recording. 3)Front 5mp camera is not wide enough for selphys. 4)The black strip with HTC logo at the end of screen which unnecessary increases height of the phone. 5)Awkwardly placed screen on off/power button. 6)I have inserted 32GB class 10 SanDisk micro SD card. Sometimes unexpectedly card gets unreadable & then immediately phone reads it again, in between this lot of applications gets crashed (apps which we move on memory card). Sometimes it doesn't read the card again once crashed. So will have to restart the phone. 7)Not all 4G LTE spectrum bands supported. Supported are 1800 / 2100 / 2500  E8 is released in June 2014 worldwide & got available in India in around July-August 2014. As of March 2015 E8 faces some serious Competition. One plus one & Mi4 are available via online retailers for much lesser price. One plus one will be good deal then Mi4 if you are on budget. Moto X 2nd generation 32 GB is also good deal if you don&#8217;t mind the non-expandable slot and want to get Vanilla Android experience. Z2 & Z3 are waterproof options, Z3 is good phone but Sony is planning to sell their mobile business because of losses, also Z3 cost lot more and Z4 is around the corner. If you have high budget then look for Flagships, like M9, M8, Nexus 6, S6, Note 4. If you have Budget of 30-32k then you will have to choose from S5, Moto X 2nd generation & E8. (Not considered other phones from Chinese manufactures) All have their pluses & minuses. E8 holds its own ground with Boom Sound, Dual Sim, 128 GB expandable option, better battery & screen. Moto X biggest merits will be 4k recording and fast android updates. S5 has better camera, more sensors but doesn&#8217;t have 801soc and have heavy Touch wiz UI. I think E8 is a good deal for 30-31k and you can get it in shops as some people not comfortable with online transactions. I am totally satisfied with my purchase and ya the phone totally is worth it.  @ Amazer Pudding Case- I also bought Amazer Case from Amazon for 549/-. It&#8217;s a light case, comes in black color with precision cutouts. Protects phone well, as I dropped phone 2-3 times from 3-4 feet. Made up of TPU material. Totally worth it.

I am TOTALLY SATISFIED.. While many still argue that Micromax is a better brand.. then here is what XOLO has better: Its the overall build quality, Screen (DragonTail) and the User Experience.

A battery with 100% charge can last for about 32-33 hours with normal usage, even on 3G network for the entire duration.  Disadvantages could be, that q1000 is a bit bulky, and GPS locking takes time, but then at this price range, there are some compromises.And haan, even Canvas HD or the likes have GPS locking issues :P Overall, I m thouroughly satisfied with this phone, and would defiintely recommend any1 who wants a budget HD Resolution phablet.

The E1 has better specs and better performance than the old one,and is one of the best 'branded' budget device coming under Rs10000.  Performance : Even though this only has a dual core processor and 512MB ram,the performance of the device is excellent. Many games like Temple Run,Riptide GP2,Dead trigger etc ran without much issues thanks to Adreno 302 GPU on board.  Some Notable features and issues 1) A dedicated walkman key on the top. 2) Camera is just a basic 3MP auto focus one with No led flash.Only WVGA@30fps Video is supported. There is no front cam.Overall disappointed. 3) The build quality of the phone is excellent,doesnt look cheap at all.The back cover has a matte finish which gives it a nice grip to hold the phone. 4) Apps CANNOT be moved to sdcard which means you are left with 2GB of storage for apps. 5) Viewing angles are OK,not that good. The brightness fades when playing tilting games like Riptide GP2. 6) Android 4.3 Jellybean,and 4.4 Kitkat update is expected. 7) Only 512 MB ram. 8) On screen home,back,multitasking buttons. 9) Phone is thicker than many other budget devices. 10) Li-Ion 1750 mAh battery - If you are a heavy internet user,not enough to get you through one full day.

Ordered the white e3, got a brand new sealed piece. The device is true to its specs just awesome in display and the perfect mid ranger device for me. Seems like Gionee has corrected all the software bugs in this device as I got it with new firmware May 14 installed. So I did not have to do any system updates. The only buggy things I found in the software were 1. the torch shortcut (volume down long press to activate) does not happen and the gionee swifkey messaging keyboard does not swipe to input (Just installed the free swipekey it works wonderful and uninstalls the gionee swifkey). Calling, sms, call record, blacklist (caller only/ not sms), loudspeaker, youtube all work well. The free screenguards are premium quality and so is the flip cover case. Earphones are adequate. Battery life is just like that for any android device. standby times are fantastic while working with wifi on is average. Jelly bean out of the box 4.2.1/ Kitkat is supposed to come by November. No charging or phone hanging issues. Butter smooth touch. Just remember to enter settings>battery>disable cpu limiter/throttling. Outdoor viewing is superb, indoor you need just 10-15% brightness settings. Display is just mind blowing, with the best viewing angles, even better than LG G3.  There is no Notification LED though. Most of the pre installed bloatware can be uninstalled. The rest can be disabled. Dual standby SIMS. Micro and Regular. Both can access 3g only one at a time. Signal catch and 3g hsdpa plus speeds are fantastic on this device. The icing on the cake, this phone is so so so so light and so so so so slim. No gorilla glass. Top end games play well. Stock App manager is fun to use and can transport apps to ext sd. Not required as you get ample 11-12 gb free from the 16gb internal. The best in built app i loved was the filemanager. Its super graphic and easy to navigate. Wow. What a phone. I thought of redmi, mi 3, honor holly, moto g2, asus 5, xperia sp and even spice dream uno. This beauty beats them all. Gionee now has a lot of service centers in India. GO FOR IT.

Features 5.2-inch 1920 x 1080 display (424 PPI ) Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, with a 2.26GHz quad-core Krait 400 ( same as in nexus 5 ) 2 GB Ram 16GB and 32GB variants 13 MP Camera 3,000mAh Li-Po battery.  Pros Great 1080P Display with a high pixel per inch density (441).  Great Camera with optical stabilization to counter camera shakes. This gives you blur free images and better low light performance. Image quality is not up to that level of HTC One,or some high end Lumia devices,but the quality is still great.G2's HDR mode works well  1080p 60 fps video capture is supported and the quality of the video is good. There are some focusing issues though.  This device is a power house which means high end games and apps can be run without any lags. Adreno 330 graphics processor makes things really smooth.  Good Battery Backup - 3000mAH battery may not be that big considering the huge display it has to power up. Still the battery backup is very solid.  It has volume and power buttons on the back cover for easier access. ( this can be considered as a con depending on your preference though )  Cons Design is not that attractive. No Sdcard slot. LG's Custom UI on top of Android Jellybean is a mixed bag.Some prefer stock Android experience over custom ones.  This will get Android Kitkat update for sure,but how long will it take remains to be seen.  Benchmarks Quadrant - 19000+ Antutu - 32000+  Overall a good flagship phone from LG with high end specs, competing directly with Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One.  LG's own Nexus 5 comes with almost the same specs but runs stock Kitkat android and is priced a few thousands lesser."]], "title": "LG G2 (White, 32GB)"}

No such hassles so far with xperia... buttery smooth till now..no lag..no crashes. its almost like my iPad! yes..its that good..  Waterproofing... Im a doctor..and have to put surgical gloves for various procedures which leaves a thin film of white dust on my hands...i invariably have to answer a few calls in between my procedures and the phone gets all dusty... once I'm done with my procedures..i simply wash the phone under the tap along with my hands! no issues for the past 2 months..(till now i was scared to do that..but now i do it regularly..)  Camera....fantastic! i have a nikon D3100 SLR while the pictures from the xperia are not dslr quality, its 13MP is good enuf to take pics in daylight so good that its very comparable to the same snaps taken on the SLR.

Battery.... these days any high end phone is expected to last a day..thats it.. this xperia lasts around 30 hours with moderate use..ive streched it to 50 hrs on stamina mode once..  so heres the bottom line...  what I liked... all of the above PLUS removable battery unlike the other waterproof xperias 4.7 inch display is JUST right.. not a monster..not a midget.. top end specs.. 15.ghz quad core krait series processor(2nd fastest processor in the world after the newly launched snapdragon 800 series), adreno320 graphics,  2GB RAM, 13MP cam  what i didn't... only 8GB internal storage..so a big SD card is a must.. i use 16gb..which i find adequate VGA front cam..pathetic..esp when u compare the beautiful 13.1MP back cam.. bezels are too big..in fact all the dimensions could be slimmed down a bit Slippery..have dropped it 4-5 times already..  What I don't mind...(not deal breakers) Not full HD screen..cant really tell the difference on a 4.7 inch screen.. and in fact, it has the same pixel density as the iPhone retina display.. which is enuf for me Not gorilla glass and can scratch easily..but this problem is easily remedied by a good screen protector Lots of sony software/bloatware..but doesn't bother me coz phone hasn't slowed one bit..and some of them are actually useful!!!

For people who are ignoring it just because its made by LG, kindly note that Google selected this brand to make flagship and authorized Android devices i.e the Nexus series.  LG has put in their best in this phone. First, the 5.2&#34; 1080p bezel less display is absolutely gorgeous to look at. Pictures and Videos are a delight to watch on this one. Text is so crisp, it leaves no margin to ask for more.  Besides being a Snapdragon 800 device, it provides the best battery backup among its class. I can easily extract 20~24 hours of usage with 5 hours screen on time. Thats remarkable for such a powerful device with a power hungry 1080p display. As rated by GSMarena, the talktime offered by G2 on 3G network is just above 25 hours and an endurance rating of 81 hours.  Talking about the camera, its a 13mp shooter with Auto Focus and Optical Image Stabilization (Only phone to have OIS in its class besides Nexus 5). Daylight pictures are great and full of details and low light images are not bad either. The camera takes a little more time than others to focus but its ok. It shoots 1080p 60fps video as well. After applying a camera mod, you can also shoot 4k 30fps and 120fps 720p slow motion video.  This phone features the best screen to surface ratio and while using it for the first time, it feels like holding a big screen with nil bezels. The internal storage is not expandable via microsd card but you can always use an OTG cable to attach usb drives. I'm using a 32GB OTG pen drive and it works great.  The UI has some nifty customization options and doesnt overload the system with bloat like samsung's touch whiz. One of my fav. is the Qslide, Quickmemo and the Cliptray. With Qslide, you can start minimized apps with resizable windows and can also change their opacity while working in the background when required. Quickmemo is a memo app where you can save notes in a second.  Being a Snapdragon 800 device, it runs the most intense apps with ease. G2 has topped most of the benchmarks as reported by Gsmarena.  Till now, I had no trouble and this phone delights me everyday with its capabilities. Excellent service as usual by Amazon, one of the most trusted site. I placed the order at night and received the message in a few hours that the product has been shipped. Received it in 2 working days, properly padded with bubble wrap and completely sealed. Extremely Satisfied."], ["5.0", "Nexus 5 vs Lg G2", "shishir moyade", "I don't understand why LG is not famous in India? This phone doesn't require a review. I will just clear the confusion for people choosing between Nexus 5 and LG G2. Here are few points of consideration-  *The back buttons are designed with some intelligence. They are not any drawbacks rather some smart thinking.  *The knock on feature is great which is not present in any other phone. You need to knock your phone to unlock it, which makes it a button free phone.  * 3000 Mah battery is crazy. I sometimes have to find my lost charger. Won't discharge.  *The customized User Interface (UI) by LG gives your phone a fresh look. Otherwise every android phone looks same. You can also download themes, fonts, wallpapers etc which are offered by LG only. Keep changing the looks.  *No need to swipe to pick a call, just put your phone on your ear and your phone will do the rest.  *Multiple Apps can be used simultaneously by swiping through the Apps. (like in Ipad)  * Camera is decent. Sound is lound and crisp. Touch sensitivity is wow. Processor is too damn fast. Doesn't hang or lag for even a second. Uncommon and district phone.

I was thinking to go for better smartphone in the market as I was fed up with other branded smart phones I used, especially battery life and began looking for and saw a couple of reviews, among all LG G2 is my first and foremost Android smartphone even today. I have been using this phone for more than 4 months now.  It is worth buying phone though price is comparatively high. I would suggest rather than buying a mobile for one year go for this and you can use this for next a couple of years. LG has done an excellent job with G2 and It's remarkably comfortable to hold; the phone's rounded edges and gently tapered back and never feels overly large when you're making a phone call.  Cool features: Long battery life Android v4.2.2 OS and can be upgraded to Kitkat version 2.26 GHz Qualcomm Quad Core Processor 2.1 MP Secondary Camera 5.2-inch Capacitive Touchscreen 13 MP Primary Camera Full HD Recording Optimum screen utilization Quick Remote feature Quick Slide feature Amazon (Gabbar deals) delivered as they promised.

Speed - Too fast for me. don't need more than this  Battery - I've been using this for two weeks and the battery with songs, video and some gaming has lasted me more than 18 hrs which is great.  LG overlay on Android - It is nowhere as bad as samsung. LG has certainly struck a balance between customization of android and pure android. I like it a lot.  Buttons - no side buttons and I'm really happy with that. I had a look at sony xperia and it was ridiculous to see how many buttons I would have deal with. This has 3 buttons, 1 power, 2 volume and you can't mess up while using it.  Headset - The headset speakers are really good quality. They are not great quality but really good quality. Extremely comfortable and aesthetically look really nice.  Camera - I've not used camera much but the pictures are really good. great contrast and sharpness. Its not very quick(i usually use a DSLR) but still manages to take good pictures.  Now the bad part - The mic in the headset provided by LG is really bad. It picks up all kinds of noise from surrounding and person on the other side of the line just can't hear you speak.

The display is really classy with zero distortion when viewed from the sides and true-to-life contrasts.

The hardware is great. Though the processor is not the latest, it is among the best (Snapdragon 800). 3 gb ram makes lot of difference to the performance of the phone. Though you might find the ram being used to the maximum level, the phone's performance is just fantastic. Phone's screen is bright and vivid. Viewing angles are good and the screen is highly visible under scorching sun. LG has done well with its software *OS). Camera is good though not the best. They have brought in multi window, one hand operation, multi tasking capabilities which looks very similar to Note 3 features. Some may miss the stylus though. The call quality is up to mark. I did not find any issues with call quality. Though i sometimes felt that the wifi signal keeps dropping. I have never felt this with my Note 2. This is a minor observation and it has not hampered my usage anyways.  Pros: 1. Performance. After using the phone for over a month, i have never felt it slow down. It takes everything you give it with ease. Its a monster. 2. Camera. Both front and back are good though not the best in class. Option to brighten selfies is a plus. 3. Value for money. The phone is packed with features (both hardware and software). For the price, this is one of the best (if you do not want to go for One Plus or the likes). 4. LG Flip Cover: I got a free LG Flip cover (Magic Window) along with the phone. I got a black phone and they shipped me a white flip cover. Initially i was skeptic to use it. But after using it, it just blew me away. The cover is just fantastic and the phone has been customized to work with the magic window which is fabulous. If you dont get a free one... buy one yourself.. it is worth it...  Cons: 1. This is not a flagship LG phone. The G Pro line is being discontinued by LG. They are going to concentrate more on G series (G2, G3, and G4). Hence leading to speculation whether this will get the latest Lollipop update. No confirmation from LG as yet. 2. Users who move from Samsung Note series will badly miss the stylus. This phone is a monster both in terms of size and performance. An addition of stylus will make this invincible. LG has sadly missed it.  Verdict... If you are looking for a big phone with great performance go for this...

The phone continues the buttonless design(on the sides) so that the buttons don't feel like bulges when phone is held in the hand, while featuring a single button on back for basic functions. The phone gives a very premium feel in hand and appears to be made of metal from a distance, which it is not. The bezels are ultra thin which may annoy some people because thin bezels make the phone more prone to breakage from the sides(this was also seen in LG G2).

Battery life is good for a moderate user(~ 10-12 hrs) but is horrible for a heavy user(~ 4 hrs). This is because the Quad HD display and powerful processor drinks up a lot of juice and hence they need a powerful battery. Processor and RAM appear to be very powerful on paper but actually there is still some lag while opening and closing some apps otherwise the phone runs smooth.

Oppo is the ONLY company in the world who officially supports custom firmwares ( like CyanogenMod ) and post links to the roms in their official website.  Lets talk about the phone now.  # Build Quality and Display N1 is a huge phone,and often times you will be compelled to use it with both hands as it packs a 1080P 5.9 inch display. It is taller than the other phablets like Samsung Mega 6.3 and Sony Xperia Ultra. The built quality of the device is top notch and you wont feel this as a cheap 'chinese' phone. The screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 3 and has a PPI of 337 which is impressive. The viewing angles are great and is a pleasure to watch pictures and videos on this big screen.  # Camera This is the standout feature of this phone. Oppo is packing a 13MP ,f/2.0 aperture,dual LED flash, rotating camera. Forget about taking out of focus selfies, with this you can rotate the camera on to the front,see the image on the screen and click the best selfies possible. The only other phone that offers such a rotating camera is Gionee ( Elife Mini E7 ). The performance of the camera is above average and most of the time it takes very good images with good color reproduction. 8 seconds exposure support is there,but without a tripod forget taking a blur free image. N1 also doesn't have image stabilization built in which you often see in many flagships.  # Software Oppo ships their phones with their custom build Android version called Color OS which is actively developed by them and new features are added time to time. Oppo also supports close to stock, CyanogenMod rom for this device which is optimized for performance. The Color OS on N1 is based on Android 4.2 Jellybean and offers a lot of useful features and is easy to use. For eg, N1 supports offscreen gestures by which you can directly launch assigned apps when the screen is off. For eg, drawing a 'V' on the screen will directly go into the torch app and a drawing a circle gets you the camera.  Since this is an 'open' device and CM team officially supports this phone, you can easily install the latest version of CyanogenMod (Kitkat 4.4.x). Many other custom roms are also supported.  # O-Touch rear panel There is a small rectangle touch panel on the back of the device, below the camera, which allows you to scroll and launch apps. It works well most of the time and is handy on such a big phone,but i don't think many would use this often. You can swipe to navigate and double tab to launch apps.  # Processor,GPU and Battery This is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 Quad-core 1.7 GHz Krait 300 processor and Adreno 320 GPU. Note that this is not the combination you see in many flagship devices out there like Nexus 5. Samsung S5, LG G2 etc. This is the last generation chipset,but the performance it offers is great and you would hardly notice any lag in your day to day usage. Adreno 320 GPU helps in good gaming performance. N1 packs 2GB of ram which is more than enough to give a smooth multi-tasking experience.  N1 packs a huge Li-Ion 3610 mAh battery which is impressive and can easily take you through the day or even 2 days with moderate usage.  # Things to Note 1) There is no micro sdcard slot in here which means you are limited with around 16GB of internal storage of which around 12GB will be available for use. However, OTG support is there, which will allow you to plugin in pendrives via an OTG cable. 2) This is the Color OS version of the device, if you are looking to install CyanogenMod or other roms visit Oppo forums or Xda for help. 3) O-Click Bluetooth Remote - This will help you to trigger camera shutter to take photos.(not sure if you get this in the box ) 4) Single Sim ( Micro-SIM ) 5) Bluetooth 4.0, A-GPS, DLNA and NFC are suported.  # Verdict Oppo N1 is a huge phone,heavier than many other flagships due its bigger battery inside, and comes with some innovative features like the rotating camera. If you are a selfie addict this is one of the best one you can get to take great selfies ( competition - check recently announced Xperia C3 which offers a wide angle front cam with soft flash ). The main reason for me to own this device , apart from this rotating camera, is the custom rom support. Oppo officially supports cyanogenMod rom,and oppo has provided free devices to other custom rom devs to make sure those roms too function very well on this device. Many flagships like Nexus 5 or LG G2,or Oppo's own Find 7 takes better low light images.So If selfie is not your thing, i would recommend going for their latest flagships Find7 or Find7a which packs a lot more punch than N1 and is definitely one of the best devices in the market."], ["2.0", "Two Stars", "Siddharth Shivram", "rotating camera broke within 2 months of usage"], ["4.0", "One of the best smartphone available in market.", "hemant", "Its been more that a month I have been using oppo N1.

While most other manufacturers have stuck with the form factor they're comfortable with, Oppo's taken the extra effort to craft a high-end swivel camera, instead of just drilling an extra hole for a fixed secondary camera. Sure, there are now many phones with satisfactory front-facing cameras, but the versatility of a swivel camera adds so much more fun to mobile photography. I honestly never thought I'd end up taking so many group selfies using the N1, but the extra clarity and remote shutter make a difference here. And of course, Oppo's build quality plus software innovation here are just as reassuring.  But, the N1 seems to have rolled off the production line before the engineers could finish tuning the swivel camera. On the bright side, with the exception of the O-Touch trackpad's awkward position, there's nothing a software update can't fix here: The camera just needs a faster shutter speed, an improved HDR mode, better white balance for red backgrounds and better video quality. Given Oppo's commitment to fixing bugs in the past, we can safely recommend the N1 to anyone who's seeking the best smartphone for the highest-quality selfies; and Android purists will also appreciate the bonus option to switch to CyanogenMod.  The Oppo N1 is a bold, yet fun phone with the noble goal of solving the selfie problem. Unfortunately, its camera is still a few updates away from perfection.

I was totally looking forward to the Sony Xperia Z1 as it has similar specs as LG G2 (you can compare this two flagships on youtube  or i personally recommand gsmarena website for point to point benchmark battles)... Then I realized that Sony Xperia Z1 has SELF SCREEN CRACKING problem, And in response the company will not take care of it at all, in ONLY INDIA JUST BECAUSE IT IS DEVELOPING COUNTRY... So it will be useless to have waterproof and elegant device if we are not secure after sell service is bad... Other devices under this price range, ARE FULL OF CRAP, believe me, please go to the gsmarena for better comparison... But as they're not aware of SONY's racist point of view for INDIA, keep in mind that unlike other countries, SONY WONT REPLACE YOUR PRECIOUS DEVICE IF IT IS CRACKED...  You guyz may find this review has more of XPERIA Z1's comparison to LG G2 but trust me, in this price range with 2.2 GHz processor, 2 Gigs of RAM, Best of graphics, Best of camera, full HD resolution and Trust, you'll find only in these twos.  Main Pros if found in LG G2 are: 1. Battery King... (You'll be surprised!) 2. 5.2&#34; screen and its arrangement 3. Optical Image Stabilization of camera (refer gsmarena site for better camera review) 4. Screen ON OFF function!  Cons: It's quite annoying that sound quality COULD HAVE BEEN BATTER...

LG has lately started to produce quality devices and Google has chosen none other than LG to push out their Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 devices.

Pros Great 1080P Display with a high pixel per inch density (441).  Great Camera with optical stabilization to counter camera shakes. This gives you blur free images and better low light performance. Image quality is not up to that level of HTC One,or some high end Lumia devices,but the quality is still great.G2's HDR mode works well  1080p 60 fps video capture is supported and the quality of the video is good. There are some focusing issues though.  This device is a power house which means high end games and apps can be run without any lags. Adreno 330 graphics processor makes things really smooth.  Good Battery Backup - 3000mAH battery may not be that big considering the huge display it has to power up. Still the battery backup is very solid.  It has volume and power buttons on the back cover for easier access. ( this can be considered as a con depending on your preference though )  Cons Design is not that attractive. No Sdcard slot. LG's Custom UI on top of Android Jellybean is a mixed bag.Some prefer stock Android experience over custom ones.  This will get Android Kitkat update for sure,but how long will it take remains to be seen.

But that&#8217;s not the case. Its very fragile. Not like its predecessor. I dropped this phone from my pocket a few days back and the display broke. And this is just a 20 days old phone. I just dropped it that one time.  This is the same lumia 1520 that nokia claims to be strong, a durable one.  I have used Nokia N95 and Nokia Lumia 800. Both were durable. Dropped it so many times and never broke. Especially the lumia 800 which my wife is still using has been dropped a million times, still works like a charm. Not even a scratch So looks like this Flagship model, Lumia 1520 is not made of the same quality as its predecessor and its pretty much fragile.  When i contacted nokia about this, they said due to this physical damage, my mobile is now out of warranty. I have to cover the expenses now. It costs around 200$ to replace the display. Come on, i cant spend 200$ every time i drop this phone.  i should have bought a case. but the problem with the case is that, this mobile is already huge enough to handle with one hand. This case might increase the size a bit, and i thought atending the calls would become tedious. And considering the durability of Lumia 800 which i already own, i thought this phone would also be made of good quality. This phone tends to slip out easily out of my hands as its huge and weighs a lot Nokia service centre ignored my case even though i am a loyal customer. I have always been a Nokia customer. Apart from the Nokia N95 and Lumia 800, i have bought several other phones including the E5 and many other Models, which ofcourse i dont remember now. They have been mailing me Mail templates instead of a proper reply.  Even though i explained my case several times, they are not ready to replace the phone. Instead they wanna consider my case as a feedback.  All these Nokia Flagships phones have been very sentimental to me. And i was very heartbroken when this mobile broke. Never broke a phone before.

The display is a 6inch,720P(245 PPI) one with good viewing angles. The build quality and design are excellent. Even the flip cover included in the box is of good quality. The back panel is matte finished giving it good grip. # Android Kitkat - 4.4.2 # 1GB Ram - Kitkat and 1GB ram works well in letting you to day to day tasks without much issues. # Quadcore Processor - Unlike many other budget devices out there, this is not powered by a Mediatek Mtk6582 chipset, rather its powered by a 1.2Ghz Broadcom chipset. Performance-wise this lags behind Mtk6582 quadcore processor and can be clearly seen when you play games on this device. Many HD games need to be set to lowest graphics in order to work lag free. # 2800 mAh battery - It can easily last one whole day of average use with Wifi/data on. # Sensors - Accelerometer,Proximity Sensor and Light sensor. # Camera - 8MP Rear and 2MP Front. You can get good pics in good lighting contitions from the rear camera,nothing revolutionary,but gets the job done. 1080P video recording is supported.  # Misc Info - 5 Point multitouch. OTG is supported,you can plugin your pendrive via an OTG cable. Installation of apps on to the SDCARD is supported.

The phone often lags. Apart from the processor, there isn't much to complain about the phone.

While I was always curious about owning a big screen phone, I never actually bought one because they were usually too expensive or had woeful specifications. I think Lava may have planted a bug in my brain as they launched the Lava Magnum X604, a phablet with good specifications and features at a price that won&#8217;t punch my bank account. So I finally bit the bullet and entered the world of phablets.  Initial impressions:  The first thing I noticed when I got the box was how compact it was. And the same feeling continued when I opened it and laid eyes on the phone. I guess, like many other people I bet, I was expecting a phablet to be as big as my nexus 7 but it&#8217;s actually very compact. And thin as well. The first thing I did was put it in my pocket and walk about a bit and it wasn&#8217;t too bulky and uncomfortable which was a pleasant surprise.  The phablet also came with all the goodies you expect along with a flip cover and a screen guard as well.  Powering up: The surprises continued when I powered it on. The huge screen HD is brilliant. After the usual start up sequence of putting in your email and everything that you have to do for every android phone. The main menu came up. First thing which I did was swipe about the menu screen and get a feel for the device. I must say that while everything is nice and peppy, there is a micro second of lag when I compare it to my Nexus 7 although it was better than my old android phone.  The inbuilt selections of apps were pretty decent and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything that&#8217;s pointless. Next stop was the camera and the display  Camera and display: The Magnum boasted an 8 mp camera and I was ready to stretch it to its paces. The camera is very good and the pictures it takes are phenomenal for its price. The phone seems to be very good for normal usage and works pretty decently with macro shots. The low light photography capability is pretty average though it is good enough to post pics and stuff.  The display is quite sharp and is really detailed. Checking out the pictures that I clicked as well as some of the pre installed wallpapers was my first taste of it but watching HD videos and movies is something else entirely. The large screen means that you don&#8217;t have to squint to see details and gives a nice feel to the phone thing. It&#8217;s perfect for people on the go who love movies but don&#8217;t have time to watch it at home.  Battery and conclusion:  The phone comes with a 2800 mAh battery which is much bigger than my old phone and hence works longer as well. The phone easily lasts for an entire day of heavy to moderate use after a charging it through the night.  One the whole, I really enjoyed using the Magnum X604 and I would go so far as to say that i changed my perception of phablets in general.

Very smooth touch - just like apple's iphone 4. Long battery life - lasts more than a day with all time 3G internet active, without internet 2 days 5.

It is a good mid range device which excels in most key areas but unfortunately falls short in some others. The 4.5 inch screen size makes it handier than most smartphones today where a 5 inch screen is the norm. The screen is vibrant and sharp. Sony's music quality output through earphones is as good as ever. The quad core processor and 2 GBs of RAM leave no room for complaints and the phone is zippy. I'll go ahead and highlight some areas which might be a cause for potential buyers and users alike: 1. The front camera is a VGA camera which is sad to be honest. Its performance is poor, to say the least. 2. Despite being backed by a 13 MP sensor, the back camera is inconsistent. It's a decent camera(3/5) but there's more noise in the pictures than I'd like to see. Its performance in low light is mediocre. 3. Wi-fi and 3g usage sap the battery a little too quickly. 4. The internal storage of the phone is 8 GB which would be a cause for trouble if you download too many applications. Not many applications can be moved to the SD card. 5. Sony's version of the Android OS is bloated with too many useless applications. On the plus side however, stock applications like walkman, album and the video player are beautifully crafted and a joy to use. 6. The flaps that cover the usb port and headphone jack are flimsy. In fact, they gave up on me after a year of usage which also means my phone is no longer water resistant.  This phone is a very decent buy overall.

Actually I came across this series a few years ago when I was looking for a phone with the following characteristics:  1. Very compact 2. Easy to use 3. Superb camera quality 4. Reasonable price  I found that the Experia series met all the above requirements.  This model from the series maintains all the above features, but at the same time it has improved upon all the features and specifications. Those who have used the earlier models will be pleased at the vast improvements. Those for whom this is the first-time buy of a machine from this series it will surely give a pleasant surprise.

Dont be surprised if you can't see these devices listed on official panasonic india mobile website. They are yet to update it there,even after being notified of the missing devices.  #Highlights and Review 1) Android Kitkat - Far better than Android Jellybean in terms of Performance. Panasonic has added some useful features on top of it. 2) Quadcore 1.3Ghz Mtk6582 processor and Mali-400 MP2 GPU - This combination is a well proven one,and is seen on many budget devices in the market.Many high end games can be played without much lag,though some you need to put to medium graphics level. 3) 1 GB Ram - ensures decent multitasking. 4) 5 inch LCD display with a qHD resolution (540 x 960 pixels, 220 PPI ) 5) 8MP Rear and 2MP Front shooter. Good enough for your sharing needs. 1080P video is supported. 6) 2000mAh battery - can last a day of average use. If you are a heavy user, probably you would need to find a charging port by evening.  # Verdict P41 has the same processor-gpu combination seen on Rs 7000 one Micromax Canvas Unite 2 and many other under 10K budget 1GB Ram devices. So if you are looking for performance, i think its better to choose other ones that cost lesser and comes with a bigger battery. If you want a good branded one, with a better screen and resolution,and a better camera overall,this can fit your needs. Keep in mind that there are devices from other well known players, xolo,gionee,iball etc at this same price range offering good,if not better specs. For eg, recently announced iball Andi Sparkle ships with an octa core one priced around Rs10500.

Therefore, call quality, email, text messaging, internet connection, battery life and reliability were the most important features.

Battery life on this phone is fantastic and one of the reasons I bought it, I can often get 3 days out of it and sometimes it lasts into the 4th day and with heavy usage I will get 2 days. Call quality is excellent and the Sony android interface is easy to use, very fast and highly customizable. Size is just right and small enough to fit in your pocket easily while still having a big enough screen to read website pages without any issues. My last phone was a windows phone and the android interface on this phone makes the windows phone interface look at least 2 or 3 generations behind. I've had it for about 1 month with no issues so am very happy. I would advise getting screen protectors front and back as the existing protectors scratch very easily."], ["5.0", "Sony Xperia Z1 Compact- Black", "Prashant Shah", "Well this is my first time writing a review. Bought this phone 2 1/2 weeks ago and have been using it constantly. I absolutely love this phone for various reasons, explained below:  Looks & Size: This phone is beautiful, has a great premium feel and feels awesome in the hand. Im back to 1 handed typing and use again, the way it was meant to be. Sure a smaller screen means lesser real estate for reading and watching videos but trust me unless u plan to watch movies on ur phone for 5-6 hours everyday then its not suitable. Otherwise for watching youtube and music videos this thing works well for me. Being a corporate lawyer I use my phone for a lot of reading- articles, emails etc. I was worried that the screen size would pose a problem but that dint happen. Reading is just as comfortable as before.  Battery Life: The battery life is super. Lasts me the whole day with heavy use and I mean from 7:30 AM to 11 PM. Consider that it has a 2300 MAH battery, the same as a Galaxy S3 but a smaller screen and better processor therefore giving a better battery life. As regards the usage of my phone- BBM/Whatsapp/Twitter through the day alongwith 2:30 of calls, 3g internet whole day, youtube streaming, emails apps etc.  Display- Not sure what everyone is complaining about viewing angles and brightness. My phone is set to the minimum brightness levels possible and its bright as my old S3 if not brighter. Did NOT notice any issues with vieiwing angles.  Xperia Transfer- Took me about 15 minutes to set up this phone thanks to the xperia transfer app. It moved all contacts, music, pics, videos from my S3 to this one. I was pretty impressed.  Android 4.4 has been released for this phone, however I havent yet downloaded this so my review os based on 4.3. There is absolutely no lag time in changing apps flipping shutting deleting etc. Works like perfect.  Sound: The sound quality is awesome and the walkman app is just too cool. Its much more convenient than the music player on galaxy devices and more customisable than an iphone songs app. I just put in my 64 gig memory card and there were all my music and videos. The sound is awesome..on calls or for music on the loudspeaker/earphones.  Accessories- Considering its a brfand new model the accessories are not as easily available in the shops. I had to order the case and screen guard separately and that also online from Amazon. I ordered the cruzerlite Bugdroid case in black. Its looks good and provides decent protection, have dropped my phone once and the case worked without complaint.  Oh yes and i did dunk this phone in a beer mug and it survived. Also use it to take calls in the shower. Hah that freaked out my girl. She was like wats that shiny black thing and i was like shiny disco balls fool its my sony xperia Z1 and lets get freeaky.

The original Z1 suffered from pure viewing angles,which sony has addressed and solved in this compact version.  Apart from the screen size,only other notable difference is the battery. This has a 2300mAh one while the bigger Xperia Z1 has a 3000mAh one.  The performance of the device is awesome. It can play high end games and HD videos without any lags thanks to its powerful processor,gpu combination. 2GB of ram ensures smooth multitasking.  #Camera Performance. This has a 20 MP camera,and performs fast and gives good image quality in good light. However,it still suffers in low light conditions with visible noise in images. Sony ,as always, provides a dedicated shutter button which is a great thing. The camera app has many useful features to assist taking better and a variety of photos.  Since the device got smaller,the battery also got a little smaller. 2300mAh with stamina mode from Sony can get you through a day of moderate usage.  Verdict : Overall a good compact phone,with great internal specs and a 720P display.

It doesn't look like a cheap chinese phone at all.  On the software side,this ships with a custom ui on top Android Jellybean 4.2. This custom ui is heavy compared to the stock ui you see on many other devices which makes it more resource hungry. The UI is largely inspired by Apple iphone.One other thing to talk about is the camera,13MP rear camera performs quite well outdoors,but gets noisy when light drops. 5MP camera front cam is good enough for video calling.  The processor/gpu combination is the same as the one you see in other 1080P devices like Micromax Turbo,Xolo Q3000 etc.  One of the common mistakes widely seen in Indian market, with Full HD 1080P display phones is the low capacity battery. Gionee Elife E6 too suffers from that. This has a great 1080P (441PPI) screen,but more pixels you cram in,more power it consumes. With 2000mAh battery,it would be hard to last you one whole day of average use. So not recommended at all if you are heavy internet user.  Verdict - A very well built phone with premium looks but ships with only 2000mAh battery. The screen quality is top notch and everything looks great on this 1080P screen. Since Micromax Knight is out,which ships with an octa core processor,and is priced the same as this,i would recommend going for that instead. If you want a device with a huge battery and 1080p display,then Xolo Q3000 is the right device to get as it ships with a 4000mAh battery. Micromax Turbo is another device to consider,comes cheaper than this,with almost the same internals."], ["4.0", "Great phone!", "chandan jain", "A GREAT phone with great features at a great price..

Its a decent device with good specs and all,but there are some issues need to be noted before buying this.  Pros - 1) Good 5.5 inch 720p screen (267 ppi) 2) Stock Android Experience,the same UI that you see on Nexus devices. 3) It doesn't look cheap.Good looks. 4) Huge battery 2600mAH - it can last 2 days of average use. 5) OTG support. - You can plugin USB Pendrives using an OTG cable.

LG has lately started to produce quality devices and Google has chosen none other than LG to push out their Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 devices.  Features 5.2-inch 1920 x 1080 display (424 PPI ) Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, with a 2.26GHz quad-core Krait 400 ( same as in nexus 5 ) 2 GB Ram 16GB and 32GB variants 13 MP Camera 3,000mAh Li-Po battery.  Pros Great 1080P Display with a high pixel per inch density (441).  Great Camera with optical stabilization to counter camera shakes. This gives you blur free images and better low light performance. Image quality is not up to that level of HTC One,or some high end Lumia devices,but the quality is still great.G2's HDR mode works well  1080p 60 fps video capture is supported and the quality of the video is good. There are some focusing issues though.  This device is a power house which means high end games and apps can be run without any lags. Adreno 330 graphics processor makes things really smooth.  Good Battery Backup - 3000mAH battery may not be that big considering the huge display it has to power up. Still the battery backup is very solid.  It has volume and power buttons on the back cover for easier access. ( this can be considered as a con depending on your preference though )  Cons Design is not that attractive. No Sdcard slot. LG's Custom UI on top of Android Jellybean is a mixed bag.Some prefer stock Android experience over custom ones.  This will get Android Kitkat update for sure,but how long will it take remains to be seen.  Benchmarks Quadrant - 19000+ Antutu - 32000+  Overall a good flagship phone from LG with high end specs, competing directly with Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One. LG's own Nexus 5 comes with almost the same specs but runs stock Kitkat android and is priced a few thousands lesser."], ["5.0", "Rockstar!

PROS- 1. A very good FHD IPS display. 2. Start up time is very less (stats up very fast). 3. very fast processing, thanks to snapdragon 800 (2.3GHz). 4. 13 MP OIS camera is too good. 5. knock on feature is very convenient. 6. Camera features are too good. 7. No need to install any app for changing theme or keyboard layout or theme and fonts its all built in u can download your favorite ones. 8. 3000 mah battery gives a good back up for a 5.2 inch screen. 9. FHD video recording at 60 FPS is very good. 10. Nice sound quality. 11. 2GB  RAM allows you to run many apps. 12. Slide aside feature is too good and useful. 13.

For board, we need to wait for a minimum of one week as it has to be shipped from Delhi  In my view most of the android phones have hardly one year life. After that it starts giving problems. I am not sure about the branded phones (like Samsung, LG, etc), but these kind of Chinese products really sucks. No dependability on these devices.  If branded phones give better life (as their hardware build quality might vary though all are using Android operating system), it would always be better to go for them (though certain features and facilities which are not covered by them).

It doesn't look like a cheap chinese phone at all.  On the software side,this ships with a custom ui on top Android Jellybean 4.2. This custom ui is heavy compared to the stock ui you see on many other devices which makes it more resource hungry. The UI is largely inspired by Apple iphone.One other thing to talk about is the camera,13MP rear camera performs quite well outdoors,but gets noisy when light drops. 5MP camera front cam is good enough for video calling.  The processor/gpu combination is the same as the one you see in other 1080P devices like Micromax Turbo,Xolo Q3000 etc.  One of the common mistakes widely seen in Indian market, with Full HD 1080P display phones is the low capacity battery. Gionee Elife E6 too suffers from that. This has a great 1080P (441PPI) screen,but more pixels you cram in,more power it consumes. With 2000mAh battery,it would be hard to last you one whole day of average use. So not recommended at all if you are heavy internet user.  Verdict - A very well built phone with premium looks but ships with only 2000mAh battery. The screen quality is top notch and everything looks great on this 1080P screen. Since Micromax Knight is out,which ships with an octa core processor,and is priced the same as this,i would recommend going for that instead. If you want a device with a huge battery and 1080p display,then Xolo Q3000 is the right device to get as it ships with a 4000mAh battery.

Build Quality - Well made and doesn't feel cheap. Back panel is soft touch  Display- 4.5 inch qHD display ( 245 ppi ) - Not bad. It has decent viewing angles and the screen is bright enough to be seen under direct sunlight.  Software - HTC's own Sense skin is running on top of 4.2.2 Android Jellybean. It ships with Sense 5 which has a unique Blinkfeed feature. The overall user experience is pleasing.  Camera - This has a 5MP BSI camera with a f/2.0 Aperture. The image quality is good but not great, noise creeps in low light photos. Dont get me wrong, you can get decent pictures with this,but dont expect Htc One kinda quality.  Processor GPU and Ram - It is powered by a Snapdragon 400 dual-core Krait CPU at 1.4 GHz and the GPU on board is an Adreno 305 GPU.

It is not much bigger than the old LG Viewty that I used to have and loved. I even bought the CAPDASE jacket which makes it even thicker but I feel evens up the lens side.  It has a decent optical zoom and better than carrying a compact camera and a phone or simply trying to take pictures with a standard phone. It has a tripod mount and i am just waiting for a mount to arrive for the handlebars of my motorcycle so that I can take travel movies.  Other negatives cited include only the 8gb internal memory, well, Its not unusual to need to buy external memeory. I upgraded to a 64gb card and put 20gb of music on, still leaving around 40gb for apps and photos. I have a pro SLR camera, with two 16gb cards, which is sufficient for my photographic needs, 40gb then, exceeds that especially when the picture size is fairly small at 16mp jpg rather than capturing RAW.  Battery life is excellent, it lasts me around one day without a charge, better than the HTC I have that lasts only 8-10 hours. The battery and SIM are easily accessible from a flip up door, so this could be a second phone that you take with you on days out perhaps.  My only gripes are that the picture size could be bigger, only 16mp, and tethering/ reverse tethering is complicated, having to root the phone to do the latter. There are only two USB options on the galaxy menu: camera or media device.I also don't like the fact that its not possible to initiate movies from the shutter button, although this does allow stills to be captured during filming, I would like to attach the camera to the strap of my backpack which would make the reverse of the phone inaccessible.  If you travel a bit and like taking photos, this could be the phone for you.  Feb 2014  I am down grading review from 4 to 3* Issues that I have found:  1.The lens has a glass outer in front of the auto lens cap, this tends to gets smudged and potentially scratched making the camera useless or would need an expensive repair.  2.I have found that tiny specs of dust/lint have started to accumulate in front of the lens behind the glass.

Dont get confused this with the Galaxy Camera which is just a camera running on Android.

It has a 4.3-inch Super AMOLED touchscreen (Resolution - 960x540, 256 ppi) with Gorilla Glass 3 for protection.  S4 zoom is powered by a 1.5GHz dual-core Exynos 4212 CPU together with 1.5GB of RAM - more than enough for your day to day photographic activities with this device.  Pros 1) 10x optical zoom 2) Sensor size - 1/2.33-inch sensor,which is the same size you get in many point and shoot cameras. 3) 64 GB sdcard support. 4) Impressive image quality for a 'smartphone',but not the best. 5) Good macro capabilities. 6) Powerful Xenon flash 7) Image stabilization - works well during video shooting. 8) Many camera shooting modes included in the camera app. 9) Good call quality. 10 A lot of creative camera apps in Playstore.  Cons 1) The display is qHD,since this is a photography centric device they should have accommodated at least a 720p screen to see the images on the screen in better quality and detail. 2) Battery life is not that great. 3) Night time shots are not that impressive. 4) Zoom ring is not smooth,which means trying zooming in while shooting video causes video shakes.One other notable problem is that,in recorded videos you can hear the zoom-in zoom-out motor sounds. (there are also on-screen zoom controls) 5) No raw shooting support.  Who is this camera for? At this price you can get better point and shoot camera's giving far better image quality than s4 zoom. So if you take photos only during some special occasions say a wedding,a party etc,this is not what you should be buying. This is for people who love to have one single device,same device to connect to internet,make calls and shoot decent pictures with good zoom capabilities.This can be the perfect device for those who loves to click and upload them to facebook,instagram etc on the move.

Poorer customer service! I needed to buy a phone in July ( 3 months ago). i went to a local store. He recommended this. it looked nice. I bought it. I figured that it didn't work. i could not scroll watsapp, i could not use playlists, videos froze the screen, all brands of memory cards were not supported. this fact is verified by the store guy by using different brands of cards. I returned it, unfortunately the store could only replace it and not give me another brand in exchange. the new phone also had issues. I figured i could not do much and made peace with it. In exactly three months, the phone got switched of every time i disconnected it from the charger. it reached a point when it did not even switch on with the charger.  when i examined the battery it had inflated from both sides. i was scared it might explode if i charged it anymore. I called the closest service centre on a Wednesday. They said i could only come before two.&#8203; i wonder why since its official timings are till 6.30. i guess everyone gets lazy. The next day no one answered any of the numbers. Finally on the third day they asked me to come and they would replace the battery. I went to this small dingy box in a dingy lane, which didn't have space for more than 10 people at a time. Most people [resent there had complaints regarding the battery. &#8203;They asked me to submit the phone. I argued that just the battery needs to be replaced. They said ok submit the battery and come after a week. I could see atleast 200 batteries in a transparent box staring at me. i asked them to replace right away. they refused. i requested for a battery replacement. they refused. i begged that i was travelling in 4 days, to replace by then. they refused. So i came back to Flipkart to buy a new phone!

I have no problem at all and works great. No lags, no hangs and nothing!  1) Music : Wow!! its got superb Amps and the external sound output from phone is loud and clear compared to Sony phones. Well, think of it like this : HTC one has two of these speakers in the front, but butterfly has one in the back.. and trust me, its not feeble to hear! Internal amplifier works great and has much more output power compared to HTC one X/ XL 2) There is a message LED indicator at the back, apart from the one in the front. I liked it :)  3)Spill proof.. well, I dont plan to go swimming with my smart phone and it does not have to be water proof completely! 4) 4.2.2 update is ready for this device with battery optimizations. 4.3 JB? I really doubt if you need it. please go with change logs and not just because some one told u that its the latest and greatest. Possible Cons (although I dont consider it much) : 1)No NFC(well, I can live with that. I dont often tap phones in the office to trasfer files ;) )  2)Battery - well.. it holds enough charge for a day and a half with 1 hour on the phone, gaming for 20 minutes, wifi on all the time and sending out 50 messages. If you actually use it as a phone, just to make calls and receive text messages, I am pretty sure that it will last for 2 days. they could have done better with the battery part, or could have introduced wireless charging... If you really want the battery to last for a long time, use it as a phone and not a video game machine. Bottom line : If you want to personalize your phone according to YOU (like scenes and skins), Sense 4 is the best one out there with quad core specs! YES, I am a HTC fan. I love their products and have received a lot of positive feedback for my phone, from people who use S4, Nexus 4 and Sony. Buy this phone ONLY if you appreciate its UI and want a decent specs. Do not compare with other phones, specs to specs and complain...
